Start Pirate’s Treasure, and continue the quest. Fish at Musa point for the diary, then continue Pirate’s Treasure until you get the rum from the crate in Port Sarim. Buy a raw chicken, three raw beef, two cheese, eight redberries, one banana and three pots of flour, depositing items (not the raw meat!) in the deposit box near the Entrana monks if you need inventory space.

  <p><strong>Total time:</strong> 6h52m</p>
  <p>Optional but recommended: slap the combat dummies to get 5 attack so you can equip your steel axe later at wintertodt. Go to the Varrock East bank, take the Pirates’ Treasure key, research package, hammer, saw, some runes for casting wind strike and coins. Note: if you want to join the Phoenix gang, follow the instructions to complete Shield of Arrav in this guide step (yellow, italicized). However, it is recommended to postpone the quest and join the Black Arm Gang later (red, underlined), since that is usually in higher demand. Go to the Varrock center, talk to Baraek and pay him 20gp to progress Shield of Arrav (Phoenix clan) make sure to check all dialogue options. Make sure you have at least 3704 gp left after the next Aubury shopping trip. Go to Aubury, give him the research notes and buy 100 mind, 100 air, 50 water, 50 earth, 20 fire runes (no rune packs). Speak with Dimintheis in Varrock East to start Family Crest. Head to Old Man Yarlo for Daddy’s home and progress the miniquest to the point you collect the waxwood logs from the crates in the kitchen. Head south to the Phoenix hideout and talk to Straven to progress Shield of Arrav then head to the Blue Moon Inn, go upstairs and open the chest at the end of the hall, read the message (you can drop it after). Go back downstairs and kill Johnny the beard (with magic) and pick up the report. Talk to Dr Harlow to progress Vampyre Slayer, buy him a beer. Buy an extra beer for later. Go back to Straven, give him the report to get the Weapon store key. Grab half of the Shield of Arrav. From now on every time you are in Varrock you may complete Shield of Arrav with a partner, at your own convenience (sooner is better). Use clan chat “osrs soa” to find a partner. If you plan to join the Black Arm Gang: head southwest to Charlie the Tramp, speak with him, then enter the Black Arm Gang hideout to the west, speak with Katrine and progress the quest.</p>
  <p><strong>GP stack:</strong> 3983 gp (assuming Shield of Arrav is not completed)</p>
  <p><strong>Items needed:</strong> 1204 gp, key, package, hammer, saw, 30 air/mind runes</p>
  <p><strong>Skills/quests met?:</strong> yes</p>

  <p>Go to the Varrock East bank. Grab a bucket of milk, raw sardine, doogle leaves, steel axe, chronicle, 3650 gp, waxwood logs, knife and all but 10 of your logs (if you have more than that remaining). Fletch remaining logs (of the original 100, so 1500 arrow shafts) into arrow shafts as you run to the east and speak with Regulus Cento to take the quetzal to Varlamore. Travel back to Varrock via quetzal and run north to the sawmill. Enter the Lumber Yard, proceed with Gertrude&#x27;s Cat until the cat goes home. Chop down a dying tree. Make the logs into a plank, buy 5 bolts of cloth and 100 steel nails, turn the waxwood logs into planks. Head east and start Rag and Bone Man I. Teleport using the chronicle, speak to Gertrude and complete the quest. Speak with Juliet. Go to the bank and grab a saw, hammer, 10 planks, 5 bolts of cloth, 3 waxwood logs, Julia’s letter and your steel nails. Give the letter to Romeo. Go to Old Man Yarlo and fix his house. Go to Marlo and complete Daddy’s Home, enter the church and speak with Father Lawrence to progress Romeo &amp; Juliet.</p>
  <p><strong>GP stack:</strong> 333 gp </p>
  <p><strong>Items needed:</strong> 3650 gp, Chronicle, bucket of milk, raw sardine, doogle leaves, steel axe, wax logs</p>
  <p><strong>Skills/quests met?:</strong> yes</p>
  <p><strong>Total time:</strong> 7h21m</p>
  <p>Bank, grab your hammer, saw, steel nails, one POH tab, GP, burnt meat, eye of newt, onion, 18 planks, 5 noted bolts of cloth and 5 noted planks (so there are 3 planks left in your bank). Break the POH tab and use your planks to train construction (6 wooden chairs, unnote your planks and cloth at Phials, 1 crude wooden chair, 1 brown rug and 1 torn curtains). Talk to Hetty to start Witch’s Potion, kill a rat, then return to Hetty complete Witch’s Potion.</p>
  <p><strong>GP stack:</strong> 333 gp</p>
  <p><strong>Items needed:</strong> saw, hammer, 86 steel nails, POH tab, burnt meat, eye of newt, onion, 100 air/mind runes, 5 bolts of cloth, 5 noted planks, 50gp</p>
  <p><strong>Skills/quests met?:</strong> yes</p>
  <p><strong>Total time:</strong> 8h07m</p>
  <p>Minigame teleport to Clan Wars, take the portal to Soul Wars. Chop teak logs on a forestry world and burn them to level 50 firemaking (note: it would theoretically be faster to 2t, but the birds will actually just kill you at your current stats).</p>
  <p>Alternatively, use 2t oak cutting to train your woodcutting, see e.g. Getting Rats for 2t Oaks, though keeping the rats in cycle while burning the logs may prove difficult.</p>
  <p><strong>GP stack:</strong> 333 gp</p>
  <p><strong>Items needed:</strong> steel axe, tinderbox, forestry kit</p>
  <p><strong>Skills/quests met?:</strong> yes</p>
  <p><strong>Total time:</strong> 10h10m</p>
  <p>Minigame teleport to Fishing Trawler, grab your leather gloves, spade, hammer, saw, one beer, a house teleport, 1500 arrow shafts and 1501 feathers and head north. Complete the Tower of Life. Adding feathers to arrow shafts as you move, break another POH tab, walk to Port Sarim and talk to Veos to go to Zeah. Do the Client of Kourend quest up to and including the point where you activate the orb at the Dark Altar (use the mine cart system to move around). While visiting Jennifer, buy shears from her shop, then visit the Shayzien Styles directly west of her general store, buy a chef’s hat, grab an orange dye and a black wizard’s hat (spawn in the building), and do a lap of the Shayzien agility course for the diary. When leaving Shayzien dig up the Clue hunter garb along the way (just north of the bridge heading east, https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Clue_hunter_garb#/media/File:Crack_the_Clue!_-_Week_2_map.png). Continue the quest until visiting the Dark Altar (use the mine cart to get there), then head to Wintertodt (again, mine card to Northern Tundras).</p>
  <p><strong>GP stack:</strong> 280 gp</p>
  <p><strong>Items needed:</strong> saw, hammer, 1500 arrow shafts, 1501 feathers, POH tab, beer, leather gloves, spade</p>
  <p><strong>Skills/quests met?:</strong> yes</p>
  <p><strong>Total time:</strong> 11h56m</p>
  <p>Do Wintertodt for a long time. If you want to get max stats in the most efficient manner continue until almost 99 firemaking, using the banked cakes for food. Your four warm items are the clue hunter garb, gloves and boots along with the rainbow scarf. If you wish to leave earlier to save some time this is fine. It is most efficient to do ‘hoptodt’ - hopping to a game where the wintertodt is around 60-70% energy, then fletching logs to get (just over) 500 points barely in time, getting the crate and xp bonus, then hopping to the next world. This is highest firemaking xp and highest loot rolls/hr, but does require a plugin/stream/scout to find the wintertodt energy percentages on other worlds. Shortly after this step it is a goal to get to level 46 fletching, if you do hoptodt (instead of no-fletch single world or multiskilling in the bank between games) you will get most of this fletching xp from todt but if not you will need more gp for fletching supplies. You may prefer to leave some firemaking gap for using an infernal axe at redwoods later (not efficient, but very low effort). Each infernal axe used this way gives 5.7m woodcutting xp and 875k firemaking xp. Levels 90-99 is 7.7m xp. If you want to take this strategy, stop training FM at level 98. Quests, random things, and 1.5 infernal axes at redwoods for 90-99 woodcutting will finish off 99 FM. We strongly recommend getting as many as possible of the following while at wintertodt:</p>
  <p>128k gp + 2.62 gp/xp for fletching (the goal is level 46, so 68k xp).</p>
  <p>While exactly 128k gp is enough, it is recommended to get a bit extra in case you unexpectedly need more runes or want to deviate.</p>
  <p>60 woodcutting (higher is better, you will need 70 later and the rest will be trained with sulliusceps and 2t teaks outside Soul Wars). You can get this elsewhere too.</p>
  <p>Uncut rubies and emeralds, at least 50 each (more is better, you will have to buy up to ~120 rubies so if you go lower you need more gp down the line. They cost 1k gp each, and emeralds cost 500 gp each).</p>
  <p>8 uncut sapphires (more is better).</p>
  <p>16 magic logs (for Desert Treasure, Mourning’s End Part I and Monkey Madness II. If you do not get enough you will need 75 woodcutting instead of 70). Note that you can only get magic logs by opening crates after level 50 woodcutting, so don’t open any crates before that point! Furthermore, the chance of getting them massively increases at level 60 woodcutting. It is therefore recommended to only open crates at level 60 woodcutting or higher. There is one more break point for opening the loot - after completing The Digsite quest, step 40 of chapter 1, getting better ores. Other skills and levels are not worth waiting for.</p>
  <p>The following logs for bird runs: 13 oak, 24 willow, 52 teak, 44 maple.</p>
  <p>10 willow logs and 20 mahogany logs for the Varrock medium diary, 11 yew logs for the Ardougne medium diary, 1 yew log for the Desert hard diary, 1 oak, willow and maple log for Enakhra’s Lament, 1 willow log for Icthlarin’s Little Helper. About 10 regular logs for assorted use. Extra mahoganies and teaks are very welcome for construction.</p>
  <p>Oak logs to cut into headless arrows, to make arrow shafts for 46 fletching (only as many as needed - you will get 190 fletching xp per oak log). 3 more oak logs for Sleeping Giants (do not cut these into shafts)</p>
  <p>30 construction (more is better, 30 is essential)</p>
  <p>2 iron ore</p>
  <p>1 silver ore</p>
  <p>1 grimy ranarr weed</p>
  <p>3 willow seeds</p>
  <p>15 harralander seeds (or more lower tier herb seeds for similar xp)</p>
  <p>~200 pure essence</p>
  <p>A raw swordfish (you can get this from tempoross later).</p>
  <p>Some silver and gold ore (~50 silver, ~100 gold is sufficient, more is better. If you don’t get enough you may have to buy some at the blast furnace later).</p>
  <p>Some fletching levels along the way (the guide will assume level 31, 15,500 xp, after this step, if you are over/under you can adjust your future plans for making steel arrows to 46 fletching accordingly).</p>
  <p>Optionally: do a small group kill on a separate world for 3000 or more points in one game for the Combat Achievement.</p>
  <p>Quite a few people worry about minmaxing the crate loot. It doesn’t matter that much, training skills up for better loot is not worth it. The optimal way to open crates is:</p>
  <p>Wait until 60 woodcutting to open any crates. If you are not staying at todt until 60wc instead open them as late as possible (when you leave todt). If you do wait until 60wc, open all but 30-50 of them.</p>
  <p>If you have remaining crates after the above step, wait until you have completed the Digsite quest to open the rest.</p>
  <p>Do not wait for other levels (herblore, farming, etc.) with opening the crates. If you have more crates open them as soon as you can use the rewards. In particular, do not wait for ‘breakpoints’ in levels to increase your loot, just open them for money to reduce time spent blackjacking. You can optionally decide to wait for completion of step 93 (tithe farming) to increase the seed yield, but this is not best.</p>
  <p>After opening all of the crates, we assume that you have exactly 128k GP as a baseline, as well as the money for 46 fletching. HCIM will need a bit more (get 200k to be safe).</p>
  <p><strong>GP stack:</strong> 280 gp</p>
  <p><strong>Items needed:</strong> 4 pieces of warm clothing, steel axe, tinderbox, cakes</p>

Buy 16k feathers from Gerrant (for fly fishing later. If you do not have level 46 fletching yet, also buy feathers to get that level.

Bank one jangerberry (optionally: bank two as it’s a possible Fairytale pt. 1 item), all the strange fruit and the golovanova tops (you will need at least 2 tops). Run west and dig up a saltpetre for the diary.</p>
  <p>You can run between the two fruit stalls for higher xp rates, but this depletes run energy. You can eat the papayas you get to restore some of that.</p>
  <p>Use the strange fruits for energy restoration anywhere you please, they are a budget alternative to energy potions at low level and are not required for anything in particular later.</p>

  <p>Ferox teleporting for run energy if necessary, chronicle teleport to Varrock.

Home teleport to Lumbridge, bank, grab items for the step below. Shear a sheep, complete the Restless Ghost. Cross the gate to Al-Kharid and start The Feud (buy the desert disguise).

Buy 9 bronze bars in the Shantay Pass, along with two sets of desert clothes (one pair of boots only), 5 Shantay passes, 16 bucket packs, 20 buckets of water, 4 bowls of water and 10 waterskins. Make 4 soft clay while you’re at the bank chest. Make sure to bring 5 buckets for Ugthanki dung and wear leather gloves during the following quests. Note: the following quests can be multiquested, but for the sake of inventory space and convenience it is fine to do Tourist Trap completely, then do The Feud after.</p>
  <p>Do the Tourist Trap up to the step where you have Ana in a barrel (Oziris has made the following guide for safespotting the Captain fight in that quest: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFxB4zWqrd8). Continue The Feud until the step where Ali the Mayor tells you to return to Ali Morrisane (last step) (pick up extra Ugthanki dung, 3 extra beers and 3 vodkas during the quest). Both the Mercenary Captain and Tough Guy can be safespotted. The Tough Guy fight takes some RNG, if your hits are poor he will despawn and you have to try again. If you have enough poor rng to hit 17 or higher magic you can use bolt spells to improve your chances. Carry chaos runes for bolt spells here! Complete The Tourist Trap, put both xp rewards on agility. Return to Ali Morrisane and complete The Feud.</p>
  <p>Take the carpet to Pollnivneach and blackjack to 31k gp (total) and 49 thieving on bearded bandits, whichever comes last (this should be the thieving level). Note: blackjacking has a high fail rate at low level, and this step is unpleasant. It gets much better around level 55-60, so hang in there. OSRS blackjacking (270k xp/h)this is the general method, only slown on the higher level bandits here but the setup is the same. At lower thieving level the fail rate is significant, you just have to drink a bunch of wines (bought at the local shop) and power through the early levels. </p>

  <p>Use the Fishing Trawler minigame to teleport to Port Khazard. Charter a ship to Land’s end. Buy 1600 soda ash and 10 buckets of slime (if it is competitive or bought out, charter to Catherby and buy them there), 10/world at a time. Charter a ship to Catherby. Buy steel arrowtips to round out 46 fletching (if you don’t have that level yet). We recommend buying 250 tips/world to save hopping but if you are low on gp you can buy 100/world instead to save some cash here. Take out a knife from the bank and a light source (grab a candle along the way and light it with a tinderbox if you don’t have any). Grab insect repellant, collect two buckets of wax and five flax (diary) and speak with Sherlock (diary). Enter the Temple of Ikov and grab some Boots of Lightness, then leave again. Start Merlin’s Crystal up to the step where you need to visit Arhein. Run to Seers, grab the fishing pass and other items for fishing contest from the bank. Continue Fishing Contest to the step where you get the trophy. Fly fish north of Seers bank to 35 fishing, banking the fish. Complete Murder Mystery while training (start the quest, get all relevant clues in the mansion, fish an inv, bank, do the relevant steps in the village, resume the quest etc.). Home teleport to Lumbridge, cross the gate to Al-Kharid (costs 10gp), run south and speak with Hassan to start Prince Ali Rescue, then Osman to resume the quest. Run south and board Ferryman Sathwood’s ferry. Train fishing at mass world Tempoross to level 56. It is most efficient to cook the harpoonfish instead of using them raw. Make sure to only cash in the reward permits after you have hit level 50 fishing - this is a significant boost to your loot!</p>
  <p>From here on add steel arrowtips to your headless arrows as you move, to get level 46 fletching.</p>
  <p>You can make a fire underneath yourself to tick manipulate cook-fish fly fish (https://streamable.com/90mz74), but beware that you want to bank some trout for quests and salmon for food for later. Note that you need at least 15 cooking for this, so you will need to train some cooking on the side, for example buying raw fish from Gerrant in Port Sarim, to make this work.</p>
  <p>If you went all the way to 99 firemaking, and therefore also made at least 99000 gp in excess of the amount you needed at WT, make a detour to Ignatius Vulcan when picking flax and buy the Firemaking cape. This has some uses both as a light source and for defensive stats, but mostly it is just iconic.</p>
  <p>Tempoross will also give random amounts of planks, nails, raw fish, gold bars, gems and other loot that will be useful later. None of these are required but all of them will help down the line.</p>
  <p>There are several Combat Achievement tasks for Tempoross. It is recommended (but fine if you don’t) to complete as many of the easy and medium tier as you can during this Tempoross grind.</p>
  <p>Optionally you can stay for the fish barrel. It is a good item for barbarian fishing and for buying karambwans (Brimhaven POH method https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDkz186YgME), some people also use it to fish karambwans (lowering the rate in exchange for longer trips, i.e. making it more afk). Staying for a fish barrel is not recommended.</p>
  <p>Solo methods for Tempoross exist, but they are difficult at low level and not recommended.</p>
  <p><strong>GP stack:</strong> 18579 gp</p>
  <p><strong>Items needed:</strong> 15600 gp, 2 buckets, knife, light source or tinderbox, fishing rod, fly fishing rod, feathers, empty pot, garlic, spade</p>
  <p><strong>Skills/quests met?:</strong> yes</p>
  <p><strong>Total time:</strong> 3d4h</p>
  <p>Fishing trawler teleport, do the fishing trawler minigame for a complete Angler’s outfit (48 games average, you can use an axe+hammer instead of needing swamp paste, bailing bucket optional for more activity. Chopping at tentacles/repairing railings is usually competitive so stay close to the railing and spam click). Make sure to collect a rusty sword along the way, and have the Tindel Marchant identify it. Also save polished buttons (if you get them). Note that once you hit 50 activity inside the minigame it will not go back down, so you can afk for the rest of the game and you will get the reward rolls. Buy two swamp paste, a hammer and four tinderboxes at the general store. Clan wars minigame teleport to get to Edgeville, speak with Marley for Below Ice Mountain. Cut 8 sapphires. Make a sapphire necklace and a silver sickle. Bring a knife and go to the Mage Arena, buy 200 cosmic runes (you won’t need these until later, so if it is very crowded you can stop at just 20). Enchant the sapphire necklace into a games necklace.</p>
  <p><strong>GP stack:</strong> 8579 gp</p>
  <p><strong>Items needed:</strong> 10000 gp, steel axe, hammer, chisel, necklace mould, sickle mould, knife, sapphire, gold bar</p>

Buy a greenman’s ale from Rasolo. Start Dwarf Cannon up to the step where you need to find Lollk.</p>

  <p>Take the spirit tree to the Gnome Stronghold, start the Grand Tree. For the next shopping trip, make sure to leave 2586 GP. Buy dwellberries, 2 buckets of milk, 1 pineapple, 10 potatoes, 3 pots of flour, 4 cheese, 1 orange, 1 gnome spice and 120 produce items (all of onion, potato, cabbage, tomato, cheese, lime, orange, lemon, pineapple and dwellberries work, cheapest in red) and 130 chocolate dust (2 for quests, 128 for energy potions) from the Grand Tree Groceries. Visit Blurberry’s bar for the barcrawl, buy a premade blurb’ sp. Collect two swamp toads and take off their legs.</p>
  <p>If you have more gp than required at this step, buy premade gnome food (all choc bombs, veg balls, ttl’s, worm holes and all battas) from the gnome waiter, banking the food for quests/generic use. This food only delays your attack by two ticks, as opposed to the 3 ticks delay from most food, so it is superior in many situations despite not healing as much.

Minigame teleport to Port Khazard, charter a ship to Aldarin, start and complete Death on the Isle.

If you only collected 2 iron bars earlier, collect 5 more upstairs in the Shields of Mistrock store. Minigame teleport back to Barbarian Assault and resume barbarian fishing to level 50 agility. Also start barbarian farming (if possible). Knife-log teak logs to tick manipulate. </p>
  <p>It is recommended to cut-eat (or cut-drop) the fish for free cooking xp. If you do not cut the fish for cooking xp you will need to train it at the mess hall (Hosidius) to level 70 later.</p>
  <p><strong>GP stack:</strong> 6708 gp</p>
  <p><strong>Items needed:</strong> rope, Glarial’s pebble, trout, water strikes, all your feathers, 6 air runes, 6 earth runes, 6 water runes, 1 knife, 1 teak log</p>

Buy 75 lockpicks and 25 ropes. Cook fish (salmon, trout and all raw fish from tempoross) between the games to replenish run energy (you can 2t cook it), make sure you have at least 10 trout for Death Plateau and 15 salmon for In Aid of the Myreque. Grab your GP, blackjack and a POH tab (equip full rogues), run south and complete Fishing Contest.</p>
  <p><strong>GP stack:</strong> 4162 GP</p>

  <p><strong>Skills/quests met?:</strong> yes</p>
  <p><strong>Total time:</strong> 4d13h</p>
  <p>Break your last POH tab, enter your house for the diary, blackjack to 1.25m GP (level 77 thieving, lower if you did more wintertodt). OSRS blackjacking (270k xp/h). At lower thieving level the fail rate is significant, you just have to drink a bunch of wines (bought at the local shop) and power through the early levels. The progression is bearded bandits to level 55, unbearded bandits to level 65 and menaphite thugs at level 65 and up.</p>
  <p>Whenever convenient past 750 total level, which will likely happen around this step or soon after (you gain a lot of levels in step 35 as well) depending on how much wintertodt you did, do Last Man Standing for points for a rune pouch (the recommended strategy is to play games for 1 def pures, either outskilling your opponents or bum rushing the closest player with dds specs at the start of the game into manual casting barrage from a distance while wielding a crossbow to confuse bots). Optionally also collect the magic shortbow imbue scroll.</p>
  <p>The guide information uses 1.25m instead, which is technically enough but not recommended. Staying for an extra 100k will help speed up buying battlestaves later and is highly recommended.</p>
  <p><strong>GP stack:</strong> 1,250,091 GP</p>
  <p><strong>Items needed:</strong> POH tab, willow blackjack, an initial set of wines (buy in Pollnivneach from Faisal the Barman)</p>
  <p><strong>Skills/quests met?:</strong> yes</p>
  <p><strong>Total time:</strong> 5d0h</p>
  <p>With 371 GP left you should hit 1.25m GP at (approximately) 1,471,755 XP, which is at level 76.</p>
  <p>We will now assume that you have 1.25m GP cash stack as a baseline when moving forward. Regardless of what your cash stack actually was (due to WT variance) at all of the steps listed above, you can stop blackjacking at 1.25m, so that will be your nominal cash stack value for everything in Section 1.3.</p>

Teleport to Camelot, if necessary run to the Coal Trucks and mine 8 coal (12 if you wish to own your own mind shield). Return to Seers Village and do Elemental Workshop I. Kill one of each elemental for the diary, but 3 earth elementals instead of 1 to save time for Elemental Workshop II later (these are some tough fights - take your best food and gear, or flinch the elementals as needed).

Hop to PVP world to rebank for all items while standing in the middle of the castle courtyard, then hop back (or just go to the top of the castle). From now on you are always assumed to wear a ring of dueling. Whenever you teleport, if you are low on run energy instead teleport to Ferox Enclave, restore your run energy, then teleport where you were going.

Kill three cows or cow calfs for the bones and cowhides. Bank them at castle wars.</p>

  <p>House teleport, fill a bucket at the well, start The Fremennik Trials with Manni, start working on getting his vote, continue with Olaf and get sent to collect a lyre - this is the wiki order, not the RuneLite plugin order. Regrettably these are not the same. Continue questing for Olaf’s vote up to the step where you cut a branch from the swaying tree (YOU DO NOT NEED 40 CRAFTING).

  <p>Grab 15 compostable items, fill the bin at the Falador patch. Run to Port Sarim, claim your previously destroyed XP lamps from Veos (one in Port Sarim, one in Piscarillius!) and put them all on Herblore (level 20). Give the bread to the beggar at the jewellery shop (Merlin’s Crystal). Visit Thurgo and complete The Giant Dwarf (if you get a bars task you can’t do you can refuse it by clicking out of the dialogue and logging out and back in, at the risk of having to go back to the secretary. You can join any consortium you prefer though the Purple Pewter is more efficient if you have full HAM robes - the ones on the east side tend to be fastest to buy ores at the blast furnace). Use the Blast Furnace (costs 2500 gp per 10 minutes) or Superheat Item to make the bars where needed. It is probably best to use the Blast furnace for larger tasks and Superheat for smaller tasks. Start Forgettable Tale… and get a kelda seed from the drunken dwarf. Find out what random item is required for another one (Rowdy Dwarf in the Laughing Miner pub). Figure out how to obtain the item and weave it into the steps below if you wish. Take the train cart to the pub under the White Wolf Mountain and get (the second) kelda seed from Khorvak.</p>
  <p>All items should be easy to obtain, although it may be smart to reroll the item (by going through the dialogue again after a few minutes) if you roll a steel dart, anchovy pizza or vampyre dust.</p>
  <p>If you wear full HAM robes and join the Purple Pewter you get to skip one task, making this the most efficient consortium to join. Furthermore, if you complete three ore tasks and then ask for another one you will get a bars task, but if you prefer you can instead go for another ores task by unequipping the outfit.</p>
  <p><strong>GP stack:</strong> 645048 gp</p>
  <p><strong>Items needed:</strong> 25103 gp, dwarven battleaxe, exquisite clothes, exquisite boots, 1 bread, various ores/bars (bought with the gp), 1 redberry pie, 1 iron bar, 2 beers (buy), dwarven stout. If you get asked for a bar that you cannot smith you can reset them. If you do this too often you will be sent back for more ore tasks, but it is still the fastest way of progressing this quest.</p>

  <p>Setting up gravestone with waterskins for low-level sandstone mining shows how to use a gravestone method to have access to more waterskins during mining. By keeping the gravestone interface open the timer doesn’t run down. This method shouldn’t be necessary for just 1600 sand though.</p>

  <p>Train woodcutting to 70, 2t teaks at the trees north of Soul Wars is recommended. If you want/need more rewards from forestry instead do this on a forestry world - you likely can’t 2t there as people kill the birds. Use fairy ring BJP to get there - either using a necklace of passage to the wizards’ tower, or swapping to the Arceuus spellbook (once) then using the Salve graveyard teleport spell. You can also keep doing hourlies and returning to the teak trees this way. If you did not get 16 magic logs from Wintertodt keep going to level 75 instead. You can also go to 75 regardless if you want, it’s ~EHP. Remember to swap to the normal spellbook on completion if you chose Arceuus during this step.</p>
  <p>Wear armour and take a few food to survive the birds and stay for a long time.</p>
  <p>When doing bird runs, do sulliusceps to get 5 sulliuscep caps (note: this can take a long time, long enough to cover multiple bird run timers). Take food, a rake and antipoison. Note: you may be able to get away with fewer than 5 caps and save some time here, but this is a bit of a gamble.</p>
  <p>Optional: train to 75 woodcutting (if you haven’t already) and on a future tree run collect magic roots to make an amulet of nature to improve your farming contracts and herb runs on kronos.</p>
  <p>2t Woodcutting Prif with moving shows how to move between trees without messing up the 2t setup. The same strategy works at Soul Wars.</p>
  <p>Alternatively, use 2t oak cutting to train your woodcutting, see e.g. Getting Rats for 2t Oaks, though keeping the rats in cycle while burning the logs may prove difficult.</p>
  <p>At your own convenience (recommended: right now) chop 300 oak and willow logs and purchase the log basket from the forestry shop.</p>

  <p>Blast furnace minigame teleport, make three inventories of steel bars and an inventory of iron bars. Alternatively you can enchant a ruby ring from a bird run), buying the ores in the shop if needed. Smelt 50 silver ore at the Blast Furnace, buying ores if necessary. If you have more silver ore, smelt it here. Using your dwarven stouts make 108 gold bars, taking you (well) past level 40 smithing. Make sure to use the ring of charos(a) when paying the foreman. Leave 27 gold bars in the dispenser - you will only take these out at level 99 smithing. Having bars in there speeds up the smelting.</p>

  <p>Teleport to Lumbridge, continue Garden of Tranquillity and smelt the two ‘perfect’ gold ores into perfect jewelry (BE CAREFUL NOT TO MAKE TWO RINGS/NECKLACES). Make mushroom pies (1-4 pies are recommended, depending on how many uncut gems you got from wintertodt. If you went for the minimum amount of wintertodt you will need up to 4, while 1 pie is enough if you went to level 97+) on the Lumbridge range. Teleport to Falador, continue Garden of Tranquillity. Make jewelry (40 rings of dueling, 45 digsite pendants, 10 games necklaces, 8 bracelets of clay, 2 sapphire amulets, turn one into an amulet of magic, 1 ruby amulet with the pie boost and turn it into an amulet of strength, 1 binding necklace).</p>
  <p>You should have some spare sapphire and emerald rings by now from your bird runs. Enchant those too.</p>
  <p>The amulet of strength will be the BiS for a long, long time (until Chapter 3, when you upgrade it to an amulet of torture).</p>
  <p>Keep doing poor man’s harralander herb runs (skip forward to step 93 to check a more detailed explanation of these) (make ~10 compost potions and ~120 energy potions to get to 16,224 herblore xp, almost level 32. The potions will be useful for turning entire compost bins into supercompost). Make sure to leave one harralander in the bank for Heroes’ Quest. You will buy water-filled vials a few steps down in the guide.</p>

Dueling ring to Clan Wars, go through Soul Wars to Edgeville, enter the Edgeville dungeon and get a slayer task from Vannaka (for the diary), cross the obstacle pipe into the sewers (for the diary) and collect ~7 red spider’s eggs (for diary steps, restore potions for Desert Treasure and a guthix balance potion against vampyres). Return to Edgeville bank, grab 50gp, a pickaxe, axe, a ring of dueling and fill your inventory with pure essence (you only need 1 really, but free xp). Make a waka canoe (but don’t use it), then run into the wilderness and buy a team cape from Richard and equip it for the diary, get sent to the Abyss by the Mage of Zamorak.

  <p>Use the willow shortbow to get 28 ranged on imps outside the Tower of Life (Fishing trawler minigame teleport, use a Lizardkicker) to collect beads. At 28 range swap to a bone crossbow and keep training until you have all beads. After killing the imps use the fairy ring to Zanaris to buy jars from Elnock if you haven’t yet, then fairy ring DIS to start and complete Imp Catcher. After that use the bone crossbow to get 37 ranged at sand crabs or on whatever slayer task you got earlier if it’s convenient (use more Lizardkickers to stay boosted by +2 or more while training). If you are killing enemies that drop any form of bones, bank at least 8 to save a bit of time later. If you are a HCIM leave as soon as you have the imp items, you will get all your ranging XP from the extra dragons in the next step.</p>
  <p><strong>GP stack:</strong> 231004 gp</p>

  <p>Check the willow trees when they’ve grown (probably in the middle of this step). Kill green dragons with ranged for 43 prayer (70 green dragons, games necklace to Corporeal Beast then run east, bank the hides with a looting bag. Alternatively, use a safespot in the green dragon room in the wilderness slayer cave, in the northeast of the room. It’s probably smart to finish 80 dragons instead in case of bad RNG at the Wilderness altar. Make sure to bank at least one spare set of dragon bones. This should give you level 43 ranged (51,012 xp). Use your remaining Lizardkickers for a slight dps increase. For using the bones up, run from Ferox Enclave). After this step, the game is safe. :)</p>
  <p>Optional: train melee with organised crime and other activities. Kill a lizardman for the diary during/after the organised crime if you haven’t already.</p>
  <p>HCIM: There are three options for HCIM, and they are all bad:</p>
  <p>Do the above step but kill more dragons, using the ectofuntus to turn them in. Ghosts Ahoy is only in Ch2St22, so either you do this without an ectophial (fairy ring ALQ on Arceuus book, dueling rings to rebank), or you reroute to complete the quest early. There are no significant requirement for doing the quest early.</p>
  <p>Instead of killing green dragons, you can safespot blue dragons in the Isle of Souls. They are way tankier and this takes considerably more time, but it means you don’t have to go into the wilderness. Taverley Dungeon is not viable right now with 51 agility. The extra bone bolts you bought previously were for the extra tanky blue dragons.</p>
  <p>Varlamore mining: mining calcified rocks gives blessed bone shards, which can be turned in at the liberation bowl with blessed wine (made from regular wine) starting at level 30 prayer - which you have. The downside is that this method scales significantly with mining level, so it’s lousy right now (but it is completely safe). Later, when going for 70 prayer, this is a reasonable alternative for HCIM to wildy green dragons, though it is still recommended to train mining more as much as possible before doing this method.</p>
  <p>You can find an example setup here.</p>

  <p>Collect 12 willow branches (6 per tree, 5 minutes to grow, only starts growing after checking health). If you had 3 trees grown, collect 18 instead. Buy 26 garden pies from Romily Weaklax in the Cooks’ Guild in Varrock along the way (or chronicle teleport to get there). Optional: buy a second inventory, they are useful. Do Enlightened Journey. If you only collected 12 branches earlier, collect 6 more now. Digsite teleport to the digsite, do A Soul’s Bane and re-enter the dungeon after completing it.</p>

  <p>Optional but not recommended: bankstand it instead.</p>
  <p>If you are not yet level 78 thieving, consider staying here for level 78 (pickpocket a dorgesh-kaan rich chest). Alternatively, collect a temporary boost (for example, Sq’irk juice) at your own convenience.</p>

  <p>Swap to Arceuus spellbook (games necklace to wintertodt into minecart). Teleport to the Arceuus Library, run east and progress Bear Your Soul to get the Damaged soul bearer. Do My Arm&#x27;s Big Adventure up to but not including the final fight. When in Ardougne after the Tai Bwo Wannai section, complete Biohazard (bring a lockpick), run north and enter the Combat Training Camp for the diary, return to king Lathas and start Underground Pass and steal from the chest for the hard diary. Do the entire Watchtower quest, using fairy ring CIQ to speed up the quest when possible (bring ranging gear for the Gorad fight). While in Yanille start Hand in the Sand at Bert, visit the Dragon Inn for the barcrawl and Hand in the Sand, check Aleck’s Hunter Emporium for the diary, buy a butterfly net, 5 butterfly jars, a noose wand, teasing stick and a rabbit snare, continue Hand in the Sand until you need to visit Sandy in Brimhaven. Collect a cave nightshade for the diary. When Watchtower is completed, home teleport, swap to the normal spellbook, use a Wizard’s mind bomb to boost for Trollheim teleport. Complete My Arm’s Big Adventure.</p>
  <p>Optional alternative, not recommended: instead stay on Arceuus spellbook and melee the Giant Roc fight.</p>
  <p>After this quest you should have level 40 herblore, including the potions made from e.g. harralanders.</p>
  <p>From here on out it is worth growing cats at your own convenience whenever on the Arceuus spellbook, using the West Ardougne teleport to hand them in for death runes. Karambwanji (the bait) are a popular food for growing cats since it stacks, fish some at your convenience.</p>
  <p>On your first cat hand-in, bring a rune shortsword and kill zombies for Rag and Bone Man II, collect the Ardougne Easy Diary reward before handing in the cat and put the lamp on Herblore.</p>

  <p>Do tithe farming until you have level 62. This should give you the points to buy herb sack, autoweed and the seed box points. Level 62 is perfect for starting boosting (garden pies from the chef’s guild, and later in Cam Torum) medium farming contracts. This level may be enough to get you seed box as well, and if not you could choose to stay a bit longer to buy that item as well. Go to the farming guild (games neck to wintertodt into minecart), get your first contract and preplant all other patches (if necessary go pickpocket master farmers for seeds). Maintain farming contracts as much as possible. You will need a whiteberry soon, so make sure to grow a whiteberry bush.</p>
  <p>While your farming is level 51-53 you can use garden pies to boost for Bologano seeds (takes approximately 6-7 pies total for these levels depending on the method) to significantly increase your xp. If you ever run out of garden pies, buy some more.</p>
  <p>Farming contracts begin here. The fastest and most efficient way to get to the farming guild is using the Kourend library teleport on the Arceuus spellbook or games necklace to wintertodt into the minecart to the farming guild, blowing glass or fletching arrow shafts/headless arrows as you move. On your first trip to the Farming guild, first travel to the North side outside the guild and chop mahogany logs for the diary step.</p>
  <p>If you downgrade into a farming contract you do not have the seeds for the best way to get some is by pickpocketing master farmers.</p>
  <p>Preplanting and skipping contracts that take a long time (&gt;3 hours for medium tier) to complete is an extremely good strategy to increase your contracts completed per day, see also the (hard contract, but applicable to medium contracts as well) flow chart in the contracts section of the farming guide below.</p>
  <p>The first time you go to the farming guild, grab six yellow dyes and seven red dyes from the shelves in the Getting Ahead farm. Mix one yellow and red dye to make an orange dye.</p>
  <p>Amateur herb runs begin here - meaning herb runs where you only visit the herb patches that are easy to access. Right now that is just the Morytania patch (Fenkenstrain teleport) and Varlamore patch (fairy ring AJP - though it is also completely fine to disregard this patch entirely), and soon you will add the Falador patch (Explorer’s ring teleport). Make sure to farm as soon as reasonably possible:</p>
  <p>22 limpwurt roots (one is for the strength potion easy Kourend diary step, complete it at your convenience using the Kharedst’s teleport and then complete the easy diary, putting the xp on Herblore. Another is for the Varrock medium diary step. Make sure to plant at least one in Catherby for the diary)</p>
  <p>Whiteberries (in either the Champions’ Guild, the Farming Guild patch or the Ardougne Monastery patch).</p>
  <p>Two toadflax for agility potions (for Tai Bwo Wannai Trio and Making Friends with My Arm).</p>
  <p>On one of your (future) herb runs plant strawberries in Ardougne for the diary (both patches recommended).</p>
  <p>You will need some prayer potions soon, so make sure to plant a set of ranarrs and snape grass early as well.</p>
  <p>Plant watermelons to harvestfill for making more compost.</p>
  <p>Growing harralanders for making energy potions is very reasonable, and they will come in handy.</p>
  <p>Grow at least 20 nightshade for the Seren fight in Song of the Elves. You won’t need this for a long time, but you may as well grow them early! If you worry you might not one-shot the fight, get 30-40 of them instead.</p>
  <p>Note: until you get to Chapter 2, Step 66 you will be stuck with ‘amateur’ herb runs as the best herb run option. It is recommended to postpone herb runs until that step, while maintaining farming contracts and other hourlies. If you find you need herblore levels, potions or want to do herb runs anyway, check the farming guide linked below and ignore patches that are difficult to reach (on the Arceuus spellbook), doing runs with fewer patches instead. This means, for example, only visiting the Falador farming patch as many times per day as you have explorer’s ring teleports. Until Chapter 2, Step 66 all mentions of herb runs refer to optional, low efficiency herb runs.</p>
  <p>When you get palm tree seeds, make sure to plant your first in Brimhaven and second outside the Tree Gnome Village.</p>
  <p>When you get yew tree seeds, make sure to plant one in Varrock after level 68 farming and 60 woodcutting, to dig up for two yew roots for the diary.</p>
  <p>Based on our estimates you will need to complete around 200-250 farming contracts (starting with medium, downgrading if you roll something slow) to bank the herbs for level 70 using Barblore later. Even if you aren’t ready to farm the herbs yet it is worth collecting the seeds.</p>
  <p>If you are asked to complete a contract that you would like to do but for which you don’t have the seeds it is worth to pickpocket master farmers for a bit (for example in Draynor or north of Ardougne) to get it. The loot scales with your farming level (and the failure chance with your thieving level), but according to this Mod Ash tweet the farming scaling only has an impact on the ranarr, snapdragon and torstol rates so the other seeds are fine. https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1400868684474765314</p>
  <p>Save 6 spirit tree seeds to plant across the world and in your POH (also keep in mind that they can get diseased and die while growing), trade all others in for t5 farming contracts.</p>
  <p>Once you hit level 85 (boostable) farming you can plant Celastrus saplings, and harvest them for bark which makes battlestaves. If you want a bit more leeway with GP you can harvest and replant these at the end of the day/when you won’t be doing farming contracts for the next 13 hours or so even if you’re not on a contract. You should typically have a ton of seeds by the time you can plant them. If you are ever low on money you can alch the staves from celastrus harvests ‘raw’, or blow and charge more orbs for them.</p>
  <p>This is particularly relevant for HCIM, who might chicken out of wish to avoid killing green dragons in the wilderness later and then lack green d’hide bodies gp.</p>
  <p>Once you hit level 58 herblore, go back to Tithe farm to buy the herb sack.</p>
  <p>The best method to do Tithe farming at this level is 25x4 Half-Replant Gricoller&#x27;s Tithe Farm! Fastest XP (~120k xp/hr)but using regular watering cans - no need to buy Gricoller’s can. Also you can left click to water the plants, it is not necessary to manual click water except on the first lap, immediately after planting. This may use energy potions at your agility level, despite the agility rework making it much more doable. As an alternative there is 20x5: Tithe Farm Updated (100 fruits in 19min 24sec - No Stams/Energy potions). </p>
  <p>You can find a complete farming guide here: 20220622FarmingGuide. It is more accurate and complete than the farming advice scattered throughout BRUHsailer. Please use this to plan your farming methods going forward. This guide also has videos and resources on tithe farming.</p>

  <p>You should be at least level 42 hunter by now. Go to Puro Puro, camp a Young impling spawn for a yew longbow (keep a bow string) and catch an essence or eclectic impling for the diary. Note: there is a bug where you can do Temple of Ikov without a yew bow, using darts or other thrown weapons (of any kind) with ice arrows equipped. If you can’t stand hunter and consider this legitimate gameplay instead, as opposed to bug abuse, you could opt for that. Grab a lockpick. Do Temple of Ikov, enter the Ranging guild for the diary and buy 10 rune thrownaxes, steal from the Hemenester chest for the diary, do Desert Treasure (kill a shadow hound in the Shadow Dungeon for the diary, also start Curse of the Empty Lord and finish Dwarf Cannon during that diamond, and collect trollweiss after the ice diamond step/after killing 5 trolls behind the ice gate, your choice) from start to finish. Use your death runes and prayer potions here.</p>
  <p>If you did not get at least 12 magic logs from Wintertodt chop a magic tree (for example in the Tree Gnome Stronghold) to get enough logs.</p>

  <p>Low level earth orbs shows a video guide with all the steps for charging orbs.</p>
  <p>Short guide to low level earth orbs:</p>
  <p>Run to the earth obelisk with 25 unpowered orbs a feather, rock cake (or enchanted symbol), paddewwa tab to get there and 3 valuable items (dueling ring, games neck, earth staff recommended. Throughout this method you will keep your gravestone up, so make sure you always have at least one item (the feather) in there! Never collect the feather unless you’re done with this step. Rock cake down to low health and die to Chronozon or the poison from a spider (at the narrow entrance) at the earth obelisk.</p>
  <p>Teleport to the bank (if you do the entire process on a PvP world you are already at a bank chest and can skip that teleport). Sip an antipoison in the bank (to prevent poison splats from the spider interrupting your charging. Alternatively, you can have a skeleton/black demon attack you and run past while the spiders cannot attack). Grab a looting bag, cosmic runes, paddewwa tab, 25 unpowered orbs (24 + Wizard Mind Bomb if needed). Break the tab, run to the earth obelisk, charge all the orbs, put them in the looting bag, grab your orbs from the gravestone (leave one item in the gravestone!), charge them, teleport out to Castle Wars/Ferox and bank.</p>
  <p>Grab your 3 valuable items and 27 orbs, teleport to corporeal beast and have him kill you. Note: do NOT purchase an instance, this will cost 100k with no upside.</p>
