**Chapter 2: Quests, so many quests**

***Despite this edition having been made public some of the purple text in this document is outdated/work in progress.*** 

***If you find yourself wanting to AFK instead of doing the active steps it is recommended to ‘afk’ 5t barbarian fish, using the methods described further in the guide (i.e. bank sturgeons/caviar, etc.). Alternatively train your melee stats by killing sand crabs in Crabclaw cave (not ammonite crabs) or Nightmare zone (after a dragon defender).***

**2.1: Quests and combat, unlock Miscellania**  
**GP stack at start of section:** 26k gp   
**Total time for section:** 9d9h \- NOTE THE DISCONTINUITY, BEWARE

1. Bring orbs with you to the Wizards’ Guild in Yanille, buy, make, and alch the staves in the shop while hopping and buying nature runes (50 per world until you have 500). Boost with a Wizard’s mind bomb to get in. Use your mushroom pies for this as needed for the first levels. Buy another inv of staves and make and alch them in the bank. Repeat the whole process a second time. This brings the cash stack up to \~162k (bring \~24 orbs, buy+alch everything slowly, then buy out another 26 staves and attach+alch in bank, repeat). After this buy staves with your entire cash stack, banking them.

**GP stack after step:** 162k gp  
**Items needed during step:** cash stack, 100 earth orbs,  
**Skills/quests met to do step?:** yes  
Total time: 9d10h

2. Run artefacts in Piscarillius while attaching the staves to the orbs and alching them while running, using your Kharedst’s memoirs for transportation and dueling rings to Ferox Enclave to bank and/or restore run energy as needed. Repeat this process of buying staves in Yanille, attaching and alching orbs while running artefacts until all 1590 have been processed. Also buy 500 law runes and 500 soul runes (50 per world) in Yanille in between buying battlestaves. Grab coins, a rope, antipoison, barcrawl card, 15 oak logs, digsite teleport and run to the sawmill, make them into planks and buy 1 iron and 300 steel nails (if you have spares from Tempoross you can skip those items) as well as five bolts of cloth. Head to the Jolly Boar Inn, complete the barcrawl and speak with the third brother for Family Crest. Games’ necklace teleport to the barbarian outpost, show the barcrawl card to the Barbarian Guard to complete the barcrawl. Toggle vial smashing. Teleport to your POH and buy two bedrooms, then build a bed in each (Oak or Wooden is fine). Next buy a dining room and build a rope bell-pull. Teleport to Ardougne, pay the estate agent to swap your POH location to Rimmington, then hire the highest tier servant possible at the Servant’s Guild \- Cook for levels 39 and below, Butler for levels 40 and up (you shouldn’t be level 50+ construction yet but if you are: good for you, and hire the Demon Butler).  
   1. *You will need a grown cat at a future point, so if you do not have one make sure to grow one during this step and the following ones.*

**GP stack:** 3m gp  
**Items needed:** Kharedst’s memoirs, 300k gp (obtained during the step), rings of dueling, earth orbs, battlestaves (obtained during the step), rope, antipoison, barcrawl card, 15 oak logs, digsite pendant, games necklace  
**Skills/quests met?:** yes  
Total time: 9d17h

3. Train construction to level 50 using oak logs at the Rimmington portal. Method: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFH6-oJrJ0o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFH6-oJrJ0o) should be \~1200 oak planks for 38-50 Construction, 60 xp per plank. Don’t wait for the servant to come back, this method will bank the planks (if your POH instance is closed while your servant returns the planks will go straight to your bank) and you can use them from the bank later (have the servant grab the planks from the bank for you while you stay in the POH), for example with oak larders. Buy a study and swap your servant for the Demon Butler (in Ardougne). If you started below level 40 it is worth upgrading the Cook to the Butler at level 40 (by revisiting the Servant’s Guild in Ardougne). Buy a Menagerie and build a house (oak or teak) so you can keep a cat for questing in your POH while raising kittens without worry.  
   1. Leave the final set of larders in the house. Also build a fancy range, oak shelves 2 and a pump and drain (requires 13 steel bars, 3 oak planks and 6 soft clay).  
   2. If you have spare oak logs (or even planks), for example from wintertodt, use those first instead of chopping.  
   3. *Optional but recommended: when in Ardougne, charter a ship to Aldarin and buy an adamant kiteshield from Shields of Mistrock for tank gear for Rex.*

**GP stack:** 2.66m gp  
**Items needed:** cash stack, knife, teak log, rune axe, saw, hammer, forestry kit  
**Skills/quests met?:** yes  
Total time: 9d17h

4. If you have (at least) two grown teak trees on Fossil Island, use the butler method to chop and make 1100 teak planks (example video of 2 tick teaks with butler plankmake: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA987x97AKQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA987x97AKQ)) using digsite pendants instead of a mounted digsite and dueling rings to bank for more necklaces and/or run energy as necessary (alternatively you can grab a necklace from the museum camp bank chest on Fossil Island after it breaks). Note that you have to take the long way (east) instead of the shortcut to the trees.  
   1. If your teak trees haven’t grown yet keep going with the guide and do this step and the next one when they are fully grown.  
   2. In case the video is confusing: after teleporting to your POH you send the butler to the sawmill with your logs, then teleport to the digsite using a digsite pendant (it is better to use a mounted digsite pendant but you don’t have one) and run back to the trees.  
   3. You can use 1.5t teaks instead, a faster alternative: [1.5 t teak planks](https://youtu.be/A2dgu4ThJbE).  
   4. After this step it is recommended to have the teak trees cut down (200gp each) and use the patches for farming xp, growing mahogany/teak trees on cooldown. This is the best farming xp in the game.  
   5. If you have spare oak logs (or even planks), for example from wintertodt, or teak logs (or even planks), for example from wintertodt or tempoross, use those first instead of chopping.

Accept the cups of tea after contracts to restore run energy as necessary. Buy the plank sack. If you have excess logs (from wintertodt) cut them into arrow shafts as you run and make headless arrows (purchase feathers as necessary, you should have plenty from bird runs).

Make up to 106 teleport to house tablets, having your butler bring you soft clay from the bank while you stand at the lectern. Make sure to leave two soft clay in the bank.  
   1. From now on you have access to POH tabs for (Arceuus) herb and tree runs. If you ever run out you can repeat this step to make more (although it is slightly better to use the humidify spell rather than soft clay bracelets, mining regular clay instead).

While in Shilo Village mine (and successfully cut) a jade and three red topazes (you can tick manipulate this to speed it up), plus enough gems (including to sell) to exchange for a machete at Safta Doc (300 trading sticks \+ 3 opals). It’s worth considering getting a few extra in case all your gems for One Small Favour break. Buy four inventories of cooked karambwans from Alfonse the waiter in The Shrimp and Parrot (Brimhaven restaurant), banking in Shilo using the Hajedy & Vigroy cart system (right click to travel, going through dialogue is cheaper but not worth the time).  
    1. Optional: if you want you can also buy lobsters and swordfish for some low level food, since most of the time is spent hopping anyway. This will double/triple the number of inventories of food you’re grabbing. Buying tuna and lower tier fish is not worth it \- premade gnome food is better in every way.

Dueling ring to Al-Kharid, buy two steel platelegs, smith a golden cannonball and two topaz rings in the furnace and enchant them into Efaritay’s aid rings at your convenience. Buy a kebab if you don’t have any, take the boat to the Ruins of Unkah. Mine sandstone, ideally with 4s,[3 tick sandstone mining at new spot (easier method)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPQ-6aZdydI), the modern method [Binxy4SandstoneSpot.png](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1En18zEdCPsmMSDFu70dPfa8TMR6X2hYd/view?usp=sharing) at this south spot shown by Binxy, until you are 10k xp away from level 60 mining (you don’t have to buy any sand for this. Feel free to get the level instead, if you want). Buy the ancient staff from Eblis. Once done, head south (rebank at the Ruins of Unkah if needed), kill Jackals and Vultures for Rag and Bone Man II and desert diary. Do Enakhra’s Lament.  
    1. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwLJm\_Zu0ro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwLJm_Zu0ro) by **5th hcim LUL** shows how to do 3s1g \- an older high xp tick manipulation sandstone mining method that does not require stamina potions, increasing mining xp/hr but getting less sand.  
    2. You can also do Enakhra’s Lament *before* mining the sandstone, so you can refill your pouches at the fountain inside the temple (camulet teleport). This is faster and also gives you a good opportunity to do hourlies. Keep in mind you now have to go to 3k xp from level 60 with mining sandstone.  
    3. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rb5BKbVXuBo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rb5BKbVXuBo) shows how to use a gravestone method to have access to more waterskins during mining. By keeping the gravestone interface open the timer doesn’t run down.  
    4. [3 tick sandstone mining at new spot (easier method)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPQ-6aZdydI)shows the 3t4s method (also linked above).  
    5. Optional and recommended (but not assumed in the detailed XP sheet): mine 25k sand total for good low level mining xp, leaving the sand in the grinder. This gets you well past 60 mining.  
    6. Now that you are level 60 mining you can solo the lowest level shooting stars that fell. One option to find one is to hop worlds, especially f2p worlds, on a location where the stars might fall. [20220129\_09-16-40CrandorTilesSeeingBothFallenStars.png](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cWWMwFOprdByinP_a_6JsqkTinnhtv_D/view)on Crandor is such a spot. Alternatively, use [https://osrsportal.com/shooting-stars-tracker](https://osrsportal.com/shooting-stars-tracker) to find a convenient one. The celestial ring is worth collecting. You can 1.5t or 2t the stars, use an adamant pickaxe for convenience.

**Skills/quests met?:** yes  
Total time: 10d22h

33. Buy 300 law runes, 1100 nature runes, top up your death rune stack to 3k (Watchtower teleport and buy in Yanille)*. If you do not have a Rune Pouch yet, use the minigames teleport to Clan Wars and do Last Man Standing to obtain both a rune pouch and a magic shortbow scroll.* Buy and smelt 1100 gold ore (or exactly as many as it takes to get to level 50\) and make a(n inventory of) mithril bar(s), buying the ore if needed. Save a few hundred gold bars for jewellery, the rest are to be alched. This uses a significant amount of energy pots, if you have/had any. Make sure to equip your ring of charos (a) to reduce the foreman cost.  
    1. If you decide to go for more smithing, and also happen to have a higher fletching level than the guide assumes, you might be able to make a mithril grapple (59 fletching and smithing, boostable) earlier than the guide assumes. These mithril grapples are needed for the Ardougne medium diary, the Falador medium diary, the Kandarin medium diary, the Karamja hard diary and the Lumbridge & Draynor medium diary, and it is worth knocking out all these steps (and with it the diaries) as soon as you have access to mithril grapples. Just keep in mind that **they can break**, so if you had to boost to make one it would be nice to first head off to the God Wars dungeon (requires 70 ranging, unboostable) and use a droptrick to grab 5 or so in the Armadyl camp (don’t forget your god protection items\!). Alternatively you can make several yourself.

**GP stack:** 720k gp  
**Items needed:** 780k gp, energy potions, gold gauntlets, ring of charos (a)  
**Skills/quests met?:** yes  
Total time: 11d9h

34. Go to Rellekka (house teleport). Grab the Fremennik Easy diary, putting the lamp on Herblore. Collect a few pet rocks. Put at least one in your POH menagerie and collect it again for the diary. Buy a berserker helmet. *Your attack should be at least level 50 by now, if it is not do a bit of slayer (see below in this same step)* first. Train slayer to get to level 50 defence, using your ancient staff as a melee weapon. Alch gold bars while doing this (you’ll get plenty of time to alch during Rex later too).   
    1. Optional: do the next step first to use a fighter torso for your training.

**GP stack:** 640k gp  
**Items needed:** cash stack, dramen staff, nature runes, fire runes, gold bars, rune sword, amulet of strength, berserker helm, etc.  
**Skills/quests met?:** yes  
Total time: 11d10h

35. Teleport to Barbarian Assault, do at least one full queen run in any role and buy a granite platebody. *Recommended: continue Barbarian Assault to obtain a Fighter Torso.*  
    1. Using ranging is generally recommended as Attacker in barbarian assault, even with low ranged level and trash tier shortbows. For all other roles wear flex or defensive gear.

**GP stack:** 545k gp  
**Items needed:** rune sword, amulet of strength, berserker helm, etc. (henceforth ‘melee gear’)  
**Skills/quests met?:** yes  
Total time: 11d12h

36. Continue Scorpion Catcher (catch the scorpion inside the Barbarian Outpost agility course), do a lap of the agility course for the diary. Do Horror from the Deep, kill the Dagannoth Mother w/ magic, like on the wiki. Collect a berserker ring from Dagannoth Rex *(optional: stay for a dragon axe)*. Bring your remaining gold bars and nature runes to alch between kills (and between hits). Leave the long way to the Lighthouse for the diary, kill dagannoths on your way out for Rag and Bone Man II.  
    1. If you get a fremennik shield, keep it for The Fremennik Exiles later (in Chapter 3, Step 21).  
    2. The easiest way to get to Rex safespot solo is called ‘xlogging’. This works as follows:  
       1. You pray mage when entering the room. If Prime is on you, go back up. If Prime is not on you, regardless of whether Supreme is on you, run south immediately and swap to pray range. Run along the south edge with protect range up until you're all the way east Then, once east (pray range still up), trap Rex in the safespot, sip a prayer potion so you're at least 40 prayer points or so, and click x to close the client. Wait up to a minute for Supreme to walk away, log back on (or try a different world but there's a risk you're crashing someone). You're now on the east side and can deal with Rex only, you're out of range of Prime and Supreme  
    3. You can find [an example setup here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y1-CsDFmapBr_hFAMVeBYcIpFEPnj_OE/view?usp=drive_link)  
       1. The tome, cape and helm can be downgraded without issue. Use steel gloves over mystic gloves.  
       2. If you bought an adamant kiteshield earlier, that is a good alternative to the tome of fire (in fact, it’s slightly better).  
    4. If your Iban’s staff runs out of charges in this grind you have to trek through the Underground Pass to recharge it.  
    5. If you run out of death runes during this grind buy more as needed. If you go significantly dry on the berserker ring you will not have enough GP to continue the guide, and will instead have to make more battlestaves from scratch. Alternatively you can start barbarian fishing for xp and growing cats in the meantime for death runes.

**GP stack:** 790k gp  
**Items needed:** 1.1k gold bars, nature runes, granite body, rune platelegs, Iban staff, death runes, fire runes, berserker helm, amulet of magic, antipoisons, premade chocolate bombs(/other high healing food, if you have any), etc. (standard Rex gear), air staff, earth runes, water runes, fire runes, chaos runes, bronze sword, steel arrow, molten glass, tinderbox, hammer, 60 steel nails, 1 swamp tar, scorpion cage  
**Skills/quests met?:** yes  
Total time: 11d20h

37.  Optional and recommended: go to the PVP Arena and imbue your berserker ring. The PVP Arena method involves either an alt/friend to boost points (go at off-peak hours, hope to get matched with each other, quickly die to the other/kill the other for points, repeat) or just suiciding to randoms for quick points [imbue scroll via pvp arena - losing method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OORAXLhdZAg). Next, alch your granite body. Train slayer to level 40 with shit tier tasks with your ancient staff (you might barely cross 70 combat near the end of this training, so get a Chaeldar task for the diary step if so), training melee on accurate to 60 attack. Buy a dragon scimitar and dragon dagger if you hit level 60 attack. You can use smoke burst (on accurate/magic) on jellies and ankou tasks. Make sure to complete your final task at the end. *NOTE: it is difficult for us to keep track of all small amounts of combat xp obtained so far, so all combat levels and experience trackers in BRUHsailer are estimates. Do not worry if you are several levels off in either direction.* Get on normal spellbook, go to Falador and start The Slug Menace. Pay the estate agent to move your POH to Kourend. Teleport to Ardougne with the cloak, start Eagles’ Peak in the Ardougne Zoo. Continue The Slug Menace in Witchhaven. Necklace of passage to Jorral, start Making History. Run to Eagles’ Peak, collect two dashing kebbit fur for Varrock Hard diary (if you have the hunter level, it’s fine if you do not), catch a copper longtail for the diary, mine some iron ore, and continue Eagles’ Peak until you have to make the disguise, make sure to collect the feathers. Teleport to Ardougne, resume The Slug Menace until you have chiselled the five special runestones.

**GP stack:** 650k gp  
**Items needed:** cash stack, melee gear (incl. torso/ring now), Commorb, swamp paste, 20 pure essence, chisel, necklace of passage, law runes, water runes, air runes, ardougne cloak 1, bird snare, rune pickaxe  
**Skills/quests met?:** yes  
Total time: 12d9h

38. Do Throne of Miscellania and Royal Trouble (fairy ring CIP to get there), obtain 100% support (buying flowers from [the flower girl](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Flower_Girl) or chopping Etceteria teak logs), kill Rabbits for Rag and Bone Man II, deposit 600k gp (or: your entire cash stack) in Misc and set it to 10 mahogany 5 maple. The mahogany logs are for bird runs (levels 49-80), the maples for arrow shafts for fletching. Also visit at least once/twice a week to restore the support to 100% (buying flowers from [the flower girl](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Flower_Girl) or raking the herb patch).  
    1. The gp will sit below 675k constantly, so your kingdom will not produce the maximum amount of resources possible per day. This is fine since we have enough time, we are only interested in getting the maximum amount of resources for our money. We will leave Misc running for up to 11 days and then collect the money that remains (you may choose to leave it running for shorter, once the gp stack gets low it really doesn’t matter much. **Make sure not to exceed 11 days though\!**).  
    2. Level 49-80 hunter is 1974 mahogany logs, so that is your target from misc. Likely your hunter level is already a bit higher, in which case you need fewer logs (960 xp each).  
    3. If you are running low on digsite pendants buy 80 rubies in Ardougne and make new digsites. Make sure to keep doing bird runs always. If your hunter is at least level 65 always chase magpie implings, along with the Taverley crystal chest they are the best way to get a runite bar for Song of the Elves.

**GP stack:** 80k  
**Items needed:** cash stack, dramen staff, iron bar, rune pickaxe, rune axe, gold ring (BH runs), cake or oak shortbow (your choice), energy potions, melee gear, prayer potions, swordfish

**Total time for section:** X hours, Y mins

40. Do barbarian fishing to 65 agility (\~88 fishing) at CoX (buy as many feathers as needed), make sure to do Barblore as much as possible. Cut-eat the fish for cooking xp, you will need at least level 70 cooking for RFD/Awowogei.  
    1. You can get to the fishing spot by using the Arceuus Library teleport (the Arceuus spell, not the Kharedst’s) into the minecart to get back. This is faster than the Kharedst’s to Lovakengj. [Example setup here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bvkdM4qzBPOepvDghnhVV3koP_qa8w8M/view?usp=drive_link) \- the gp predates the Zeah favour rework and is not necessary.  
    2. Cut-eat the fish for cooking xp, you will need at least level 70 cooking later. *If you decide not to, then you’ll have to do Mess Hall, which is slower.*  
    3. For an explanation on the Mount Quidamortem barblore (can be afked, just bank the sturgeons), see[20230127LowLevelBarblore](https://docs.google.com/document/d/157zVUeEu4fkuJxjWfhTjNajR39478bBoUVRVVDeAm-w/edit?usp=sharing). Warning: this document is several years out of date, and just covers the basic idea.  
    4. Maintain cats, bird runs, contracts and (hardwood and fruit) tree runs, and optionally also include herb runs. Collect misc for mahogany logs for bird runs whenever necessary. If you run out of/low on digsite pendants go buy \~80 more rubies in a gem shop (Ardougne/Kourend pre completing Moons of Peril, Cam Torum after as it is cheaper and closer to a bank).  
    5. If you prefer to do this as a low effort/afk activity you may instead choose to weave the fishing in during other steps (instead of grinding this all at once). The levels are not needed until step 64 of this chapter.  
    6. Depending on your fishing rate your 2 weeks of Misc could be over during this step, make sure to take out the remaining GP at that point (or on some future step, whenever it happens).  
    7. If you run out of soul runes go buy 200 more for teleports(/hourlies).

**Skills/quests met?:** yes  
**Total time:** 15d21h

63. MLM for coal and gem bag (repair the strut along the way for the diary). Do low level **group** Volcanic Mine (this is a bit of a trek) for the prospector hat, and optionally for the rest of the gear as well. Check out [https://discord.gg/FXPUrUp](https://discord.gg/FXPUrUp) for finding teams. Complete the Falador hard diary step. Complete the Falador easy diary, putting the lamp on slayer.   
    1. At MLM after hourlies you can run back from the Falador patch after a herb run, or use the Arceuus Spawn Point teleport to get back to Falador.  
    2. Similar to the barbarian fishing you can choose to spread this out over multiple steps, although this time you need at least 72 mining by step 64 and you need to have completed MLM by step 73\.  
    3. If you think the coal and gem bag are not useful enough you can instead opt to first get \~68-70 mining through other means (in particular, sandstone or blast mining). This option will mean you will be short on gp and have to make a set of air staves from scratch to adjust.  
    4. There is a tick manipulation method to significantly increase the speed of Motherload Mine (credit to Port Khazard and Drøgøn for discovering this). You can find a short example clip of this here: [https://imgur.com/a/UkY7Ytj](https://imgur.com/a/UkY7Ytj) (the clip has a metronome sound for timing). The method works as follows:  
       1. You need an **adamant** pickaxe, other tiers don’t work.  
       2. The method, explained below in more detail, works the same way you would 3t mine (e.g. 3s1g, or granite) but *on a successful mine, click the next ore again on the xp drop, so that the total cycle is 4t* on a success and 3t on a failure. Note that ‘click’ here means ‘click processed on this tick’, so you have to give the input 1t earlier.  
          1. tick 1: herb tar rock 1t away  
          2. tick 2: interact  
          3. tick 3: still interacting  
          4. tick 4: herb tar rock 1t away (does nothing if succeeded) \- this is the tick 1 of the next cycle if you failed  
          5. tick 5: click same rock u did in tick 4 (incase you succeeded) \- this is the tick 1 of the next cycle if you succeeded  
       3. Theoretically this represents an increase of approximately 40% in xp/hr at level 70 mining, though realistically the gains will be lower due to having to move to a new spot more often.  
       4. [OSRSMLMMotherlodeMineSpot.png](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MKP4-fvu9jv6iEeMSC36stdk96Gwj3tA/view?usp=share_link)shows a recommended location (in the southwest corner) for having multiple veins close to one another. Alternatively you can pick a closer spot to the deposit chute but have to adapt more to veins depleting.  
       5. [3t/4t (3.5t?) double roll motherlode mine example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WiU4Z40CN0) shows the method in full, with an explanation in the description of the video.  
       6. [Tick manip Motherlode Mine example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6oxLDGAkkY) shows a non-optimised example clip, slightly north of the recommended spot.  
    5. Your \~11 days of Misc should be more than over by now (they probably were a long time ago), make sure to take out the remaining GP (fill up the cash stack to at least 200k total) if you haven’t already even if the time hasn’t passed.

**GP stack:** 200k gp

Total time: 16d22h

64. Start Swan Song, continue Eagles’ Peak until you need to report back to Charlie (last step). Visit the Wise Old Man in Draynor Village. Visit Charlie to complete Eagles’ Peak, use a necklace of passage to Eagles Eyrie and take multiple eagle rides (back and forth to each location, finishing in the desert) to progress three diaries. Run to the Shantay Pass to collect the Desert medium diary reward and put the lamp on Slayer. Take the fairy ring to the Piscatoris hunter area (AKQ), optional: when in the Piscatoris region box trap a ferret and then rabbit snare \+ ferret to catch a rabbit for a rabbit’s foot, then string it for extra eggs on future bird runs, run to Piscatoris and continue Swan Song. Complete Swan Song. Start and complete Making Friends with My Arm, boosting your agility level with an agility potion if necessary. ***Good herb runs start here.***  
    1. Make the Fire of Nourishment (three Fires of Eternal Light optional), grab an iron pickaxe, mine all the basalt (using your rune pickaxe) and salts for all the fires, make 100 Stony basalt and 100 Icy basalt. In total this requires 200 basalt, 1050 Efh, 1000 Urt and 1300 Te salt.  
       1. Optional: also make the Fire of Dehumidification and the Fire of Unseasonal Warmth \+(350 Efh, 150 Te and 400 Urt salt).

**GP stack:** 225k gp  
**Items needed:** cash stack, 10 mist runes, 10 lava runes, 5 blood runes, airtight pot, rune pickaxe, rune axe, tinderbox, hammer, ring of charos(a), dramen staff, Ardy Cloak 1, melee gear, prayer pots, swordfish, yellow dye, swamp tar, necklace of passage, rope, energy pots, teasing stick, box trap, rabbit snare, law runes, soul runes  
**Skills/quests met?:** yes  
Total time: 17d1h

65. Do barbarian fishing to 99 fishing at CoX (buy as many feathers as needed), make sure to do Barblore as much as possible. Cut-eat the fish for cooking xp, you will need at least level 70 cooking for RFD/Awowogei.  
    1. **NOTE: if you are not aiming to max in the future you can skip this step, and instead train agility to level 72 manually (at Seers rooftops).**  
    2. You can get to the fishing spot by using the Arceuus Library teleport (the Arceuus spell, not the Kharedst’s) into the minecart to get back. This is faster than the Kharedst’s to Lovakengj. [Example setup here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bvkdM4qzBPOepvDghnhVV3koP_qa8w8M/view?usp=drive_link) \- the gp predates the Zeah favour rework and is not necessary.  
    3. Cut-eat the fish for cooking xp, you will need at least level 70 cooking later. *If you decide not to, then you’ll have to do Mess Hall, which is slower.*  
    4. For an explanation on the Mount Quidamortem barblore (can be afked, just bank the sturgeons), see[20230127LowLevelBarblore](https://docs.google.com/document/d/157zVUeEu4fkuJxjWfhTjNajR39478bBoUVRVVDeAm-w/edit?usp=sharing). Warning: this document is several years out of date, and just covers the basic idea.  
    5. When you hit 66 herblore make a super defence potion in the Fremennik province for the Fremennik hard diary.  
    6. Maintain hourlies (contracts, bird runs, hardwood and fruit tree runs, herb runs, optionally seaweed \- you will never need more than 12.5k seaweed). You can stop growing cats if you want though it’s still good to continue, after all you’re fishing for cat food nonstop.  
    7. *Optional alternative: use the firefighter method[Tempoross - 80+ Permits/Hour - Solo Firefight Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4tNw3ZjeI) at Tempoross for high points/hr to get a fishing barrel, then resume the barbarian fishing grind.*

66. Swap to the regular spellbook. Complete Recipe for Disaster by following the steps below:  
    1. Dueling ring to Al Kharid, take the gnome glider to the Feldip Hills. Speak with Rantz to progress RFD/Skrach until you are asked to meet him in Karamja.  
    2. (redirected) POH tab to Brimhaven, take the travel cart to Shilo village. Resume Legends’ Quest all the way to the final step (have obtained the totem pole). While in the jungle chop a teak and mahogany log, collect a palm leaf (chop a palm tree) five times (drop and pick up), make and eat an oomlie wrap (kill an oomlie for food, use palm leaf, cook and eat), collect a vanilla pod along the way for RFD/Sir Amik Varze and kill a deathwing inside the Viyeldi caves for the diary. Head to the northwest of Tai Bwo Wannai village and light a fire on the coast for RFD/Skrach, take the boat back to Rantz and prepare a cooked jubbly.  
    3. Ardougne Cloak into a fairy ring to the Legends’ Guild (BLR), go inside and complete the quest, putting the lamps on herblore. Go back outside, take the fairy ring to Zanaris. Grind a sweetcorn into flour if you haven’t yet, then go into the Evil Chicken’s Lair and resume RFD/Varze until you have the brulee.  
    4. Take the fairy ring CLR to Ape Atoll, do all of RFD/Awowogei up to and including the step where you have the cooked stuffed snake.  
    5. Teleport to Lumbridge. Complete RFD (including the Culinaromancer fight), lamping Herblore. Buy barrows gloves.

67. If you cannot yet enter the Warriors’ Guild (130 combined attack and strength), train your attack/strength with slayer tasks until you can (your goal is 60 atk 70 str). Enter the Warriors’ Guild, kill cyclopes to get a dragon defender (bank some black knives along the way). Your attack and defence should both be at least level 60, if they are not train attack to 60 first, then defence to 60\. After this train defence as high as it will go during the defender grind.  
    1. If you do not get to level 60 defence from the dragon defender grind, train your defence to 60 with slayer tasks or sand crabs.  
    2. Cheese potatoes are a reasonable food source for many situations (though worse than 15-healing premade gnome food). Buy 1000 of either of them. You may mix and match.  
    3. Buy a defence potion.  
    4. If you haven’t already, go to either the PVP Arena or to NMZ and imbue your berserker ring and salve amulet.  
       1. The PVP Arena method involves either an alt/friend to boost points (go at off-peak hours, hope to get matched with each other, quickly die to the other/kill the other for points, repeat) or just suiciding to randoms for quick points [imbue scroll via pvp arena - losing method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OORAXLhdZAg).  
       2. For a guide on NMZ, see [OSRSNMZGuide.txt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rg9o4JvmpqZZrBRPD53jlF-AM0-dE-XM/view?usp=share_link) or [I figured out how Nightmare Zone points are calculated. New meta for AFKing with absorption pots to get good XP/hr and decent points/hr\! : r/2007scape](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/k6n3gg/i_figured_out_how_nightmare_zone_points_are/). Briefly, there are four main methods:  
          1. Afk easy rumble: pick 5 high xp bosses, afk in easy rumble with absorption potions. 20 minute afk, medium xp, almost no points.  
          2. Afk hard rumble: pick 5 high xp bosses, rock cake down to 1hp, absorption potions. \~8 minute afk (after that point your 1k charges are out and you have to cake back down and refill your absorptions), high xp, medium points.  
          3. Hybrid hard rumble: following the reddit link, pick a mixture of bosses that give good points and are afk, then copy the method for afk hard rumble. \~8 minute afk, medium xp, good points.  
          4. Active (‘points’) nmz: only disable the bosses in the list below. fight them actively. When annoying bosses pop up, ignore them until you roll ultimate power. Not afk, high xp, very high points.  
             1. Corrupted Lizardman  
             2. Elvarg  
             3. Dad

             9. Essyllt  
             10. Corsair Traitor  
    5. Go to NMZ and collect enough points (using the above guide) for redirection scrolls. From here on you have redirected POH tabs for herb runs, tree runs and general use.

**GP stack:** 215k gp

68. Tackle organised crime for intelligence along the way and hand it in at Captain Ginea for the diary. Catch a chinchompa in the Kourend Woodland. Collect T5 Shayzien outfit from the combat ring. Collect the medium Kourend & Kebos diary. Put the XP lamps on slayer. Do A Kingdom Divided (need to be on the normal spellbook, lamps on Slayer), using melee for the fights. Grab the skull near the Shayzien graveyard dungeon entrance and buy redberries in Kenelme’s Wares (Piscarilius) along the way. Minigame teleport to Mort’ton, start and complete His Faithful Servants miniquest, which includes doing a complete barrows run (all six brothers). It is recommended to complete the [Defence? What Defence?](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Defence%3F_What_Defence%3F), [Can't Touch Me](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Can%27t_Touch_Me), [Pray for Success](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Pray_for_Success) and optionally also [Just Like That](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Just_Like_That) tasks on this run, dds speccing Karil (and hoping for good hits or resetting on a failure), maging the four melee brothers and meleeing Ahrim.

**GP stack:** 215k  
**Items needed:** melee gear, cheese potatoes, stat-boosting potions, prayer potions, a defence potion (3 dose), volcanic sulphur, molten glass, dark essence block, an axe, fire bolt runes  
**Skills/quests met?:** yes  
Total time: 22d20h

69. Kill green dragons with defensive melee and thralls until you reach level 65 defence. Do King’s Ransom (XP on herblore), then the Knight Waves Training Grounds. Set your spawn point to Camelot. Use the bones at the Chaos Altar to get to 60+ prayer.  Return to the green dragons, killing 1.3k total with defensive melee (to 70 defence, swap to accurate, i.e. attack training, after) banking both bones and hides using a looting bag. Along the way kill one mammoth and an ent, chopping some yew logs from the ent for the diary.  
    1. The standard setup (with or without dragonfire potions) is: Helm of Neitiznot (risked), Dragon Scimitar, Dragon Defender, Amulet of Strength, Barrows gloves (+1), Proselyte top \+ bottom, Berserker Ring (i), Ardougne Cloak 1, Climbing Boots, Rada’s Blessing 1, Resurrect Superior Skeletal/Ghostly thrall runes (unless you have access to the Greater spell at level 76, boostable from 73 with a Wizard’s Mind Bomb. If so, use that instead) and book. Use a games necklace to Corporeal Beast then run east to get to the dragons (1250 or 1500 total level worlds are usually empty), and dueling rings back to Ferox to bank and restore.  
       1. The [example setup looks like this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zy9vpKCF4NMlpTuRPPE7MxpKcpkMCQxr/view?usp=drive_link), although you may not need as much food.  
    2. The best strategy for completing the Knight Wave Training Grounds is not flinching or poison, but simply fighting them using food and potions and letting the knights kill you once you run low on supplies. This will let you continue at the knight that killed you, making it very easy. The minigame is safe so HCIM can use this method too.  
    3. This will get your defence to 70 (and, once you use the bones on the Chaos Altar, also prayer to 70), unlocking Piety.  
    4. At some point your stats are high enough you might be within reach of completing the easy tier of the Combat Achievements, giving you a quick 5k xp lamp for a skill of your choice (probably herblore).  
    5. *HCIM: you can opt to train through calcified rocks in Varlamore instead, offering blessed bone shards at the liberation bowl. Note that this scales with your mining level, so optionally you could choose to do more mining (sandstone, granite or gem rocks) first.*

**GP stack:** 215k gp  
**Items needed:** melee gear (as mentioned), looting bag, cheese potatoes, stat-boosting pots, runes for thralls  
**Skills/quests met?:** yes  
Total time: 23d12h

70. Cash in the prayer xp at the Chaos Altar when convenient (use the suicide method at off-peak hours in random worlds recommended). If you have spare red topazes you can make burning amulets.  
    1. After one of your inventories, run into the King Black Dragon Lair for the diary.  
       Tele out to Ferox using a dueling ring or suicide.  
    2. Pest control minigame teleport, do a novice and intermediate game of Pest Control.  
    3. If you have enough fossils for three display cases and also completed Curse of the Empty Lord:  
       1. Teleport to Varrock, pray at the altar in the palace with smite active. Build three fossil display cases and speak with the information clerk for xp, with historian Minas for an xp lamp and Orlando Smith for the diary. Collect the Varrock hard diary reward, putting the lamp on herblore.  
       2. *If you do not have enough fossils for two display cases postpone this to step 72\.*

71. Tan your green dragonhides into green dragon leather in Canifis. Make a green d’hide shield. Craft all remaining hides into green d’hide bodies. Alch the bodies (buying nature runes as necessary), e.g. during artefacts, underwater or afk. Cut your maple logs into arrow shafts (more artefacts), turning one into a maple shortbow for the diary while bankstanding at Seers. Also make a superantipoison potion there. Buy feathers (if you don’t have plenty of those already from bird runs) to get to level 60 and make all into headless arrows, ideally while afking underwater to get more seaweed spores.

**GP stack:** 1.9m gp  
**Items needed:** green dragonhides, coins, nature runes, staff of fire, maple logs, knife, steel nails, feathers, Kharedst’s memoirs, log basket  
**Skills/quests met?:**   
Total time: 23d16h

72. You should be level 51 (or higher) slayer. Make sure you have finished the Curse of the Empty Lord miniquest (if you haven’t, do it now, putting the lamp on slayer). Teleport to Varrock, make sure to grab the Dragon’hai history book from the Varrock Palace library if you don’t already have it, pray at the altar in the palace with smite active. Run east to the quatzel to go to Varlamore and do Twilight’s Promise, Meat and Greet and At First Light (note: the hunter rumours are currently not efficient, but if you want the rewards you can go for them at any time after this quest). During At First Light catch a Sunlight antelope (east end of the island, requires level 72 hunter, a teasing stick, knife and logs \- grab a Trapper’s tipple or two at the hunter’s guild for a \+2 boost if needed) and kill a jaguar for their fur. At the hunter’s guild buy two mixed hide bases, and either pay Pellem to have the furs made into mixed hide boots (your best ranged boots for now) and a mixed hide cape (your best melee cape for now) or boost your crafting level if you have a spare mushroom pie to do it yourself. After this start and complete Perilous Moons (for the fights your dragon scimitar is fine, even for ice. Use the moss lizards and moonlight potions for supplies) and The Heart of Darkness. Slay a Brine rat to complete the Fremennik medium diary, putting the lamp on herblore. Grab a rope, salve teleport, dip your enchanted silvthrill rod in the well to make the Rod of Ivandis and complete In Aid of the Myreque, Darkness of Hallowvale, A Taste of Hope and Sins of the Father (all lamps on herblore). Use the Efaritay’s aid during the Vanstrom Klause fight in Sins of the Father \- you should only need one ring, the second is spare in case you die or run out of charges.  
    1. We will continue lamping slayer to level 58 for access to Cave Horrors, and after that put all lamps on herblore instead. You may choose to lamp more/less slayer depending on personal preference. There is more than enough lamp xp.  
    2. This unlocks Yarnio’s Baked Goods shop, a slightly better shop location for Garden pies than Romily Weaklax.  
    3. You can now complete the Varrock hard diary, if you haven’t before already., Teleport to Varrock and speak with the information clerk for xp, historian Minas for the Curse of the Empty Lord xp lamp and Orlando Smith for the diary. Put the lamps on slayer or herblore as mentioned previously.

**GP stack:** 1.9m gp  
**Items needed:** law runes, soul runes, silvthrill rod, rope, dramen staff, plank, 8 nails, hammer

73. Catch \~1.5k grey chins for level 55 ranging (at Soul Wars \- you can take an axe to chop the nearby teaks in case you mess up your knife-log). Catch ***\~1.5k red chins*** in the Feldip Hills. Train your ranging in the MM1 tunnels (short fuse) to level 62 (55 with grey, 55-62 with red). Make sure to equip a salve amulet (ei) *(glory is better if you have it)*.  
    1. *Optional alternative: skip this step and AFK the range training at crabs, you can even go to 70 but it is not really worth going beyond that.*  
    2. *Second optional alternative: after getting 50 ranging with either method, do A Night at the Theatre to lamp Ranging four times (80k xp total), then use either method to train to level 62 after. You will probably need someone to carry you for A Night at the Theatre, but this is going to be true even if you go at some later point.*  
    3. If you have the herblore level to make ranged pots go and teleport one inventory of zamorak wines and make them all into potions, repotting frequently while chinning.  
    4. Buy an upgraded device from Ava at level 50 (worth leaving for).  
    5. At level 60 you can equip your mixed hide boots.  
    6. [Osrs 1 Def Pure Chinning guide and Experience rates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UuFi3OOQmg) and [OSRS Pure Chinning Guide (Maximizing XP rates)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kUYAVc4QVg) show the mm1 tunnel method, though it is better to use a spot one curve deeper into the cave. The best location is shown (poorly) in [this image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xEUAySR-eE490VBDjNsymEquWXDByJra/view?usp=sharing).  
    7. Optional: go do the Fight Caves for a fire cape. It will take quite a long time to get one, so we recommend getting one on step 27 of Chapter 3 instead. But if you feel confident and want one soon, this is the best moment.

**Read this step in its entirety carefully. This step contains the Hallowed Sepulchre grind to level 82 agility.**

8. You will be doing floor 3 runs until 82 agility. Along the way you want to loot certain coffins for hallowed marks and generic loot. It is optional but recommended to continue all the way to 98 agility instead. The following coffins are recommended:  
   1. On floor 3, loot the enchantment obstacle (only on the **ONE** side, [20240224\_F3\_Enchant\_West.png](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-q9jW2J46BBdQ8Qh2f9QRS0AwfoEv9jt/view?usp=drive_link), so on 50% of all runs). With a Hallowed focus (costs 100 hallowed marks) you will never fail the enchant and it will default to the lowest level enchantment spell you have on you. Without one the fail rate depends on the level of the spell and it will default to the highest one you have on you. It is recommended to use lvl-5 enchant before you have the focus, and lvl-3 enchant after. The XP gained for each spell is the same, regardless of level.  
      2. On floor 3 each side has a grapple ([20240224\_F3\_Grapple\_West.png](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l38Wk-sdHPmi3ahadbpa511LA6nuMpFH/view?usp=drive_link), [20240224\_F3\_Grapple\_East.png](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C4mKTsH7Usv8Wtj0y69DXl-boUr215Bo)). You may choose to loot these right from the start, but failing them loses a lot of time. If you collect the Hallowed grapple (costs 100 hallowed marks) it is optional but not recommended to loot these until level 82 to speed up getting other loot.   
      3. Floors 1-2 are not worth looting, although if you are chasing collection log slots you have to loot these too. [20240224\_F2\_Grapple\_West.png](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-mHEJrSrEDFlxy26XKRernodWjdk9dQl/view?usp=drive_link)for floor 2 and see below for floor 1\.  
      4. If you are using mahogany planks with rune nails (in BRUHsailer you will not be doing this) to build bridges it is efficient construction xp to build the bridge in floor 1 (on two out of four sides, so on 50% of all runs, [20240224\_F1\_Bridge\_Coffin\_West.png](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lQE2JXt08migxFrMjDeey6oySzCA4Lsb/view?usp=drive_link)) but not to cross it. Alternatively this is required if you are hunting the collection log slots.  
   9. Based on the above, the recommended order for purchasing the Hallowed items is Focus \> Instances \> Ring \> Hammer \> Grapple. If you have banked vampyre ashes it is worth buying the Hallowed symbol and using them on floor 4 only. It is not efficient to collect vampyre ashes. You may always buy a few Hallowed tokens in case of a terrible run, so that you may finish it in time (and buy new tokens after).  
   10. You will be doing Fletchp*alch*re (fletching headless arrows and casting high alchemy while moving at sepulchre). Feel free to bring the herb sack and plank sack. Maintain hourlies. It is also possible to blow glass inside the sepulchre, this is even more efficient than other multiskilling options. Most of the time is spent alching, not fletching.  
   11. Once you have a little bit of cash restart misc to get teak logs for planks for building bridges (2400 total, 8 days). 10 teak 5 herb(/other) at Misc, along with 10 mahog 5 herb(/other) for future bird runs if you run low/out. Keep in mind that changing the Miscellania allocation works retroactively.  
       1. Keep misc running even if you have enough planks for Sepulchre. Once you have enough planks, swap to 10 mahogany 5 herb(/other) for future construction training. As your cash stack grows just dump 7.5m in there (we will assume this going forward).  
       2. You will only need these teak planks by the time you hit 82 agility, not before then.  
   12. After Misc is up and running, buy arrow shafts and headless feathers (in smaller chunks) to get to a total of 1 million headless arrows through fletchpalchre.  
   13. Alch (all) rune bolts for good magic xp along the way.  
   14. We recommend buying the initial helpful items first and then spending all further hallowed marks on hallowed crystal shards (the teleports) or saving them in case of a buff/change to the shop.  
   15. If you want a change of pace you can afk mine daeyalt essence for runecrafting later. There is also a high effort daeyalt (“dae-alch”) method: [https://streamable.com/it7kry](https://streamable.com/it7kry).  
   16. You can do this grind in smaller parts, or quit entirely at a lower agility level. [Example setup here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TVUPrJca_Wau7msvkiuMtZTvJagXbyRY/view?usp=drive_link)

**GP stack:** 3.6m gp  
**Items needed:** green/blue d’hides, box traps, knife, teak log, salve amulet(ei), whatever other ranged gear you can scrounge up, crossbow, Sara items, hammer, fire staff, nature runes, a lot of money (obtained during the step, spent during the step).  
**Skills/quests met?:** yes  
Total time: 25d4h

74. Do Blast Mining [https://streamable.com/l3ylry](https://streamable.com/l3ylry) to get to 330 addy ore total, buying the dynamite from the shop as needed. Hybrid ore uim smelt ([Hybrid ore UIM smelting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfBdN77X130)) your mithril from MLM. Smelt your gold ore from MLM. Use the UIM gold method ([Lazy UIM Gold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLtU98HE1bA)) to train your smithing to level 70, getting permission from the foreman to use the blast furnace for free at level 60\. Turn all your mithril bars into platebodies (Varrock west anvils, make 10 bars into 150 nails, make a mithril 2h sword for Devious Minds and \~5 bars into grapples along the way), then alch them (similar to before). Hybrid ore uim smelt your addy (buy coal as needed) into bars. Use UIM gold to train your smithing to (15,000 xp away from) level 74\. Make sure to equip your ring of charos (a) until level 60 for reduced foreman costs.  Start and complete Defender of Varrock (there’s a free 5k xp lamp after the quest at Historian Minas in the Varrock Museum, put it on slayer if you aren’t level 58 yet and herblore otherwise). Make 4950 adamant nails (make sure to save an adamantite bar) with your bars at Varrock west anvils.  
    1. Optional: you can go to level 70-73 only and boost for making the nails instead.  
    2. After this create 5 mithril grapples and complete and collect the rewards for the Ardougne medium diary, the Kandarin medium diary, the Lumbridge & Draynor medium diary (all lamps on slayer) and complete the grapple step for the Falador medium diary.  
    3. Now that you have a mithril grapple you can do the quests The Curse of Arrav and The Path of Glouphrie. It is recommended to do them now, but you can also leave them for later.

**GP stack:** 1.9m gp  
**Items needed:** tbd  
**Skills/quests met?:**   
Total time: 25d22h

75. *Note: if you are not planning to max you can reduce this step, although the lack of prayer potions might prove to be an issue for slayer later. You will also need to obtain more planks and train construction at your own convenience if you do not go to at least level 96 agility during this step. That being said, 98 agility at Sepulchre is a loooong grind, so give serious consideration to reducing/splitting it.* **Read this step in its entirety carefully. This step contains a huge Hallowed Sepulchre grind.**  
    1. After level 82 agility you are good for a while, but there is no real reason not to continue at Sepulchre. It is optional but recommended to continue all the way to 98 agility. The following coffins are recommended:  
       1. Floor 4 has a bridge (only on **ONE** side, [20240224\_F4\_Bridge.png](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mukzsxluTSC_5_WFc5-L-N8cjQ0DtK4L/view?usp=drive_link) so on 50% of all runs). With a Hallowed hammer you will never break nails while attempting to build this bridge, and it is highly recommended to buy this hammer before reaching level 82 agility.  
       2. Floor 4 has an enchantment obstacle  (only on **ONE** side, [20240224\_F4\_Enchant\_and\_Bridge.png](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GAWKq9nYm73goXncshJlDBT658r71Bwd/view?usp=drive_link) so on 50% of all runs). If you have (and continue to be) tick perfect this is not worth looting, as it means you will lose the timing for ‘sword skip’ (and the 1:20-1:23 lap time) on the next section. If you are not tick perfect up to this floor the enchantment obstacle is efficient to loot, and works identically to that on floor 3\.  
       3. Floor 5 always has an enchantment obstacle [20240224\_F5\_Enchant.png](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-3bo0ZphU2vj83m3LqaO7ucVpUwLuRRv/view?usp=drive_link), a grapple obstacle [20240224\_F5\_Grapple.png](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aqPi5c_nvITWZFejwzsVsO7VzE90IUYU/view?usp=drive_link) and a bridge obstacle [20240224\_F5\_Bridge.png](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oOIRFIRyMkpPOnYR1sRhgZcwQs8IyANk/view?usp=drive_link), followed by a grand coffin [20240224\_F5\_Grand\_Coffin.png](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vV-j1q8sf_gpyVn56z8Dr9tb9H9zq5bb/view?usp=drive_link). Every single one of these is efficient to loot.  
       4. Floors 1-3 are not worth looting anymore, although if you are chasing collection log slots you have to loot these too. If you are using mahogany planks with rune nails (in BRUHsailer you will not be doing this) to build bridges it is efficient construction xp to build the bridge in floor 1 (on two out of four sides, so on 50% of all runs, [20240224\_F1\_Bridge\_Coffin\_West.png](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lQE2JXt08migxFrMjDeey6oySzCA4Lsb/view?usp=drive_link)) but not to cross it.  
    2. You will be doing Fletchp*alch*re (fletching headless arrows and casting high alchemy while moving at sepulchre) all the way to 98 agility. Feel free to bring the herb sack and plank sack. Maintain hourlies. It is also possible to blow glass inside the sepulchre, this is even more efficient than other multiskilling options. Most of the time is spent alching, not fletching.  
    3. After Misc is up and running, buy arrow shafts and headless feathers (in smaller chunks) to get to a total of 1 million headless arrows through fletchpalchre.  
    4. Alch (all) rune bolts for good magic xp along the way.  
    5. We recommend buying the initial helpful items first and then spending a lot of hallowed marks on hallowed crystal shards (the teleports). Doing this for levels 82-98 will on average grant the following loot and xp:  
       1. \~24.5m gp (not including the costs for fletching, nature runes, planks etc)  
       2. 565k thieving xp, 444k construction xp, \~600k fletching xp and 3.2m magic xp (primarily through alchs).  
       3. 6.1k cosmic runes (these are useful for enchanting bracelets for gp and jewellery for general use later)  
       4. 8.1k death runes  
       5. 44.7k law runes (these serve no long term purpose but can be used to fill a nexus, for example)  
       6. 44.7k blood runes (a good initial stack for barraging during slayer)  
       7. 44.7k soul runes (these have some uses for Arceuus and barrage spells, as well as being required for Tumeken’s Shadow eventually)  
       8. 12.7k adamant bolts (next to useless)  
       9. 1100 monkfish  
       10. 102 prayer potions (4)  
       11. 336 sanfew serums (4) (useful at DKS and the nightmare)  
       12. 152 grimy ranarr weeds  
       13. 336 ranarr seeds (\~2.0k (4)-dose prayer potions when farmed, a good starting supply for slayer)  
       14. 72 strange lockpicks (for Barrows later, although the meta is to only do a little bit of barrows, using around 5-10 lockpicks)  
       15. 2.12 Rings of Endurance (88% chance to get at least one)  
       16. 16.2k hallowed teleport crystals \- **this is more teleports than you will likely use for banking on the road of all activities combined to maxing, so instead it is a good idea to partially save the hallowed marks (e.g. for future updates, potentially amylase) or spend it on loot sacks.**  
    6. If you want a change of pace you can afk mine daeyalt essence for runecrafting later. There is also a high effort daeyalt (“dae-alch”) method: [https://streamable.com/it7kry](https://streamable.com/it7kry).  
    7. You can do this grind in smaller parts, or quit entirely at a lower agility level. [Example setup here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TVUPrJca_Wau7msvkiuMtZTvJagXbyRY/view?usp=drive_link)  
    8. You can use Parasailer’s Hallowed Sepulchre calculator: [20240115 Hallowed Sepulchre: Looting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1orNUuGmhMWQamytxwrVyZI_c6fLWZH4J0yJX1nRLgXM/edit?usp=sharing) to check your loot, xp, material requirements etc. and customise your strategy. A few notes:  
       1. This calculator only works for levels 82+, and does not include f1 bridge building for xp. If you wish to build this bridge adjust the number of bridges per run afterwards manually.  
       2. The sheet is default set to sell law and soul runes. To fix this go into the ‘High’ tab (bottom left) and uncheck the boxes for selling those runes.  
    9. The floor 4 brazier, [20240224\_F4\_Ash\_Coffin.png](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XBB2mAIQwKKakNe62b0fx9gP46q8LGiE/view?usp=drive_link), is not recommended as it is not efficient to collect the ash in the first place. If you already have some this is the best use for it though, after buying the hallowed symbol.

**GP stack:** 22.5m gp

76. At your own convenience make Catherby POH tabs for your herb runs (at the lectern on Lunar Isle). If you have reached level 70 fletching at Sepulchre (or are close enough you are willing to boost for it), teleport to Seers village and complete the Kandarin Hard diary, doing all remaining steps sequentially and putting the lamp on slayer. Remember that the goal is to lamp to 58 slayer, then go back to lamping herblore. Build the following in your POH, boosting when necessary:  
    1. Marble lectern  
    2. Spirit tree  
    3. Teak armour case  
    4. Mahogany cape rack  
    5. Teak fancy dress box  
    6. Mahogany magic wardrobe  
    7. Oak toy box  
    8. Teak treasure chest  
    9. One or two portal rooms (optional) (2 limestone bricks and 9 teak planks per room, plus 100x the teleport runes cost)  
    10. **The total item requirements for this are: 1 marble block, 1 magic stone, 1 gold leaf, 1 spirit sapling, 19 oak planks, 17 teak planks, 8 mahogany planks.**  
    11. If you have a fish barrel, move your POH to Brimhaven (move it back after), then buy a few thousand (between 2,000 and 10,000 recommended) raw karambwans using the barrel method in this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDkz186YgME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDkz186YgME). Karambwans are the best food at all levels, and give incredible cooking xp (using a method called ‘1t bwan cooking’). See [OSRSRecklessLadHowDoesFoodWorkV2.png](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xn4YfME8C4Gqm5A5qh-T9f0-XHN4_2CQ/view?usp=share_link)for information on how food works. Without the barrel, feel free to ignore this.

77. Do the Mage Arena I miniquest, followed by the Mage Arena II miniquest. Pick your favourite god (Zamorak is slightly more useful than the others for protection in the God Wars Dungeon, but any choice is fine). Along the way/after mine a mithril ore at the Pirates’ Hideout mine and complete a lap of the Wilderness Agility course. Kill Chaos dwarves for a muddy key, open the muddy chest in the centre of the Lava Maze. Kill an ankou at the Forgotten Cemetery, then enter the God Wars Dungeon (god wars protection is necessary\!) and kill a bloodveld  
    1. Optional: if you want multiple upgraded capes you can kill the bosses of Mage Arena II multiple times to obtain more capes.  
    2. The staff is necessary for the wilderness hard diary. After this you can high alch the staff for some gp, if you want.

Make your way to Lunar Isle. Start and complete Dream Mentor (lamp on ranged). Swap to the Lunar spellbook, teleport to Waterbirth, visit Jatizso and mine 5 adamantite ores after this step for two diary steps. POH teleport, make a super defence potion in Rellekka and collect the Fremennik hard diary, putting the lamp on slayer. Swap to Arceuus spellbook. Teleport to Draynor Manor and run out west for a scout for The General’s Shadow.

Make sure to unlock Uglug’s Stuffsies. Swap to the normal spellbook for the Slash Bash fight to use Crumble Undead. Make a composite ogre bow (comp ogre bow) and 150 mithril brutal nails, kill 125 chompies for the diary. Speak with Rantz to collect a (handful of) Chompy bird hat(s).

83. Teleport to Lumbridge. Go into the Dorgeshuun mines and start Land of the Goblins. After being teleported to the goblin caves, finish The General's Shadow, then continue Land of the Goblins and complete it in full (the transportation is awkward, you could swap to the Lunar spellbook but there is no good way to Draynor in that case. There is a crate with an unlimited supply of goblin mails directly east inside the temple, beyond the guards).

**Skills/quests met?:** yes  
Total time: 35d10h

89. Make sure you have a runite bar (if you do not you have three options: 1\) hunt Magpie implings in Puro Puro; 2\) kill Vyrewatch Sentinels for 1/46.5; 3\) trade rune platelegs for one at [Nest (nice) \- OSRS Wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Nest_\(nice\)). This third method is recommended). Do the entire elf quest line: Regicide, Roving Elves, Mourning’s End Part I, Mourning’s End Part II, Song of the Elves. Pick the crystal bow reward from Roving Elves. You have all but one item on the regular part of the 50 item list for MEPII – you are missing unicorn horn dust (and whiteberries if you didn’t save any). Furthermore you need the randomly chosen ticket, book and key (all are easy to obtain). You may also want a spare hammer and chisel. Also make sure to farm belladonna(/nightshade) in the Draynor patch to collect at least 8 nightshades for the Seren fight (optional: use explosive liquid from the digsite instead), and also buy blood+death runes and make 6-10 phoenix necklaces.  
    1. *Check out the quest guides for complicated steps, use ancients \+ phoenix necklaces and nightshade/belladonna for the Seren fight.*  
       1. ***Rock cake and ds2 orb do work in the Seren fight, contrary to wiki and other sources. However, activating them is negated when there is a ranged projectile incoming (this is normal behaviour for these items). This means you can use them to maintain your hitpoints level, but cannot use them to proc the phoenix necklaces during special attacks.***  
    2. *Example clip: [OSRS Song of the Elves boss with phoenix necklaces (no brews)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kccSC5VM8s)*  
    3. *If you are really struggling with the Seren fight an alternative option is to make several Guthix Rests which don’t delay your next attack when drunk, and also make it very easy to manage your HP during the fight for phoenix necklace procs.*  
    4. [Fragment of Seren written guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y4fh4-oWjLiIRKht3mt_MOG5M-GQJiw9RtLEZhwYEjQ/edit#)explains the methods for defeating the Fragment of Seren in detail on a low level ironman.
