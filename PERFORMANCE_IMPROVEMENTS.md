# Performance Improvements

This document outlines the performance improvements implemented in the HCIM Guide.

## 1. Service Worker for Offline Support

### Features
- **Offline Caching**: Caches critical resources (HTML, CSS, JS, images) for offline access
- **Network Fallback**: Serves cached content when offline, fetches from network when online
- **Cache Management**: Automatically cleans up old cache versions
- **Update Notifications**: Notifies users when new versions are available

### Implementation
- `sw.js`: Service worker file with caching strategies
- Registration in `main.js` with update detection
- Offline/online status indicators
- PWA manifest for app-like experience

### Benefits
- Works offline after first visit
- Faster loading on subsequent visits
- Reduced server load
- Better user experience in poor connectivity

## 2. Lazy Loading for Images

### Features
- **Intersection Observer**: Uses modern browser API for efficient detection
- **Fallback Support**: Works in older browsers without IntersectionObserver
- **Smooth Loading**: Fade-in animation when images load
- **Performance Optimized**: Only loads images when they're about to be visible

### Implementation
- `initializeLazyLoading()` function in `main.js`
- CSS classes for lazy loading states
- Automatic detection of `data-src` attributes

### Benefits
- Faster initial page load
- Reduced bandwidth usage
- Better performance on mobile devices
- Improved Core Web Vitals scores

## 3. Preload Critical Resources

### Features
- **Critical CSS**: Preloads main stylesheets with fallback
- **Critical JavaScript**: Preloads essential scripts
- **Critical Pages**: Preloads chapter pages for faster navigation
- **Font Optimization**: Preconnects to Google Fonts for faster loading

### Implementation
- `<link rel="preload">` directives in HTML head
- Resource hints for external domains
- Conditional loading with fallbacks

### Benefits
- Faster rendering of critical content
- Reduced layout shift
- Better perceived performance
- Improved First Contentful Paint (FCP)

## 4. Additional Optimizations

### Notification System
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Offline/online status alerts
- Service worker update notifications

### PWA Features
- Web app manifest for app-like experience
- Installable on mobile devices
- Standalone mode support

### Performance Monitoring
- Console logging for debugging
- Error handling for failed loads
- Graceful degradation for unsupported features

## Usage

### For Developers
1. Service worker automatically registers on page load
2. Lazy loading works with any image using `data-src` attribute
3. Preload directives are already in place
4. Monitor console for performance logs

### For Users
- Guide works offline after first visit
- Faster loading on mobile devices
- Can be installed as a mobile app
- Automatic updates when available

## Browser Support

- **Modern Browsers**: Full support for all features
- **Older Browsers**: Graceful degradation with fallbacks
- **Mobile**: Optimized for mobile performance
- **Offline**: Works without internet connection

## Future Enhancements

- Image compression and WebP support
- Advanced caching strategies
- Background sync for progress data
- Push notifications for updates
